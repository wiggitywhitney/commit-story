# AI Tools Lab Guest Preparation Guide

## Show Overview

**Hosts:** Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean
**Audience:** Developers, engineers, and technical professionals interested in AI-assisted coding
**Format:** Conversational, hands-on demonstrations with live walkthroughs
**Vibe:** Healthy skepticism toward AI hype, exploratory, practical focus

## Your Unique Value Proposition

You bring real-world experience building and using AI development tools:

1. **commit-story** - An MCP server for development context journaling
2. **AI-powered telemetry instrumentation** - Practical OpenTelemetry integration
3. **Hands-on Claude Code user** - Real experience with slash commands, MCP servers, and AI workflows

## Key Talking Points

### 1. The Problem You're Solving
- Developers lose context between sessions
- "What was I thinking when I wrote this?"
- Context switching costs in modern development
- Knowledge transfer challenges in teams

### 2. The commit-story Solution
- MCP server integration with Claude Code
- Captures development context automatically
- Journal entries tied to actual code changes
- Bridges the gap between "what happened" (git) and "why it happened" (context)

### 3. AI-Assisted Telemetry
- Automating OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- From manual to AI-assisted observability
- Real examples of where it works (and where it needs human review)

### 4. Lessons Learned
- What works with AI coding assistants
- What doesn't work (be honest!)
- The importance of structured context (slash commands, hooks, etc.)
- MCP servers as a game-changer for extensibility

## Demo Ideas

### Quick Win: commit-story in Action
1. Show a journal entry with captured context
2. Demonstrate how it helps on returning to code later
3. Show the MCP server integration with Claude Code

### Technical Deep Dive: AI + Telemetry
1. Show before/after of uninstrumented code
2. Walk through AI-generated instrumentation
3. Discuss what you review/validate in the output

### Behind the Scenes: Your Development Workflow
1. Your slash command setup
2. How you use Claude Code in real work
3. Context engineering strategies

## Questions You Might Be Asked

**Q: Why did you build commit-story?**
A: [Share your personal pain point about losing context, context switching costs]

**Q: How reliable is AI-generated telemetry?**
A: [Be honest about where it excels and where human review is critical]

**Q: What's the learning curve for MCP servers?**
A: [Share your experience, barriers, and breakthroughs]

**Q: What's next for AI in development?**
A: [Your vision: more structured context, better tool integration, observability of AI itself]

## Things to Have Ready

### Technical Setup
- [ ] commit-story running and ready to demo
- [ ] Claude Code environment configured
- [ ] Example code for telemetry demonstration
- [ ] Recent journal entries to reference
- [ ] Screen sharing tested

### Reference Materials
- [ ] Your recent CFP abstracts (great talking points!)
- [ ] commit-story GitHub repo link
- [ ] Examples of before/after code with AI assistance
- [ ] Any metrics or results from using these tools

### Stories to Share
- [ ] A specific moment when commit-story saved you
- [ ] A time when AI telemetry caught something you missed
- [ ] A time when AI got it wrong (authenticity!)
- [ ] Evolution of your AI-assisted workflow

## Match Their Vibe

### Do:
- Be conversational and exploratory
- Show real code and real workflows
- Share what doesn't work alongside what does
- Maintain healthy skepticism about AI hype
- Focus on practical, hands-on demonstrations
- Admit limitations and areas for improvement

### Don't:
- Oversell or hype your tools
- Make it sound like AI solves everything
- Skip over the challenges and learning curve
- Be purely theoretical - show, don't just tell

## Your Unique Angle

**"When the Codebase Starts Instrumenting Itself"** - This is your hook! The idea that:
1. AI can help instrument code for observability
2. AI can capture its own development context
3. The meta-nature of using AI to make AI usage more observable

This aligns perfectly with their audience's interests in:
- Practical AI tool usage
- Development workflow automation
- Emerging patterns in AI-assisted development

## Conference Talk Connection

You're working on conference talks about this exact topic. Use that:
- Share insights from preparing your CFP
- Test your narrative with this audience
- Get feedback on what resonates
- Build your public speaking presence

## Final Reminders

- **Be yourself** - Your authentic experience is valuable
- **Show, don't just tell** - Live demos are more engaging
- **Be honest** - This audience appreciates real talk about limitations
- **Have fun** - The hosts create an exploratory, conversational environment
- **Engage with their questions** - They're genuinely curious, not trying to stump you

## Post-Show

- [ ] Share any links or resources promised during the show
- [ ] Connect with hosts on social media
- [ ] Watch for episode release and engage with comments
- [ ] Use feedback to refine your conference talk content
- [ ] Consider writing a blog post about the experience
