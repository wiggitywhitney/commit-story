# Aarhus Sightseeing Itinerary

## Thursday
**Morning:** Start at **Moesgaard Museum** (MOMU) - explore the exhibits and walk on the roof trail. The museum sits at the edge of the forest with trails leading down to the beach.

**Midday:** Hike the **Moesgaard Beach trail** - after the museum, take the scenic trail down through the forest to the dramatic coastline (about 2-3km).

**Afternoon:** Head to **Marselisborg Forests** including the **Deer Park** - it's close to Moesgaard area, so easy to reach. You can bike or take a short bus ride.

**Evening:** Return to city center for dinner and explore the **Latin Quarter** streets as you wind down.

## Friday
**Morning:** Visit **Godsbanen** - explore the creative spaces, artist studios, and whatever events/exhibitions are happening. Very chill, artsy vibe.

**Afternoon:** Do a self-guided **street art tour** - start in Aarhus Ã˜ (harbor area) then head to Frederiks Bjerg neighborhood. Rent a bike to cover more ground!

**Late afternoon/Early evening:** Walk through **Riis Skov forest** - it has coastal paths and forest trails, beautiful for a late afternoon wander before you leave.

**Optional if time:** The **Infinite Bridge** is amazing but requires ~30 min travel each way, so only if you have a relaxed schedule and want to squeeze it in early Friday morning before Godsbanen.

## Notes
- Balances nature, art, and offbeat experiences without rushing
- Aarhus is very bike-friendly - consider renting a bike for getting around
- The city center is compact and walkable
