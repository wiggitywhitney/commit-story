# Branch + PR Workflow Experiment

**Test**: PRD-32 Phase 3 on feature branch with CodeRabbit review

## Predicted Pros
- CodeRabbit catches bugs/issues
- Cleaner git history (one merge vs many commits)
- Practice for when we add collaborators
- Safer main branch

## Predicted Cons
- Extra time/overhead
- Journal generation complications
- AI reviewing AI code might be noisy
- Workflow friction for solo dev

## After Experiment

### CodeRabbit Review Results (PR #34)
- **Review time**: ~4 minutes
- **Bugs found**: 0
- **Security issues**: 0
- **Functional problems**: 0
- **Nitpicks**: 1 (remove test comment)
- **Pre-merge checks**: 3/3 passed
- **Code feedback**: All "LGTM!" comments

### What Actually Happened

**Pros Realized**:
- ✅ **MAJOR: Experiencing dev workflow firsthand** - invaluable for product perspective
- ✅ Fast automated review (4 minutes)
- ✅ Comprehensive summary with sequence diagram
- ✅ All checks passed
- ✅ Professional validation of approach

**Cons Realized**:
- ⚠️ Only caught 1 trivial nitpick (test comment we knew about)
- ⚠️ AI reviewing AI code = thorough but no insights
- ⚠️ Now have overhead of fixing nitpick + pushing + re-review
- ⚠️ Adds friction to workflow

### Initial Assessment
CodeRabbit review added minimal value for code quality (existing workflow already sufficient), but **experiencing developer workflow friction firsthand is valuable for building better products**.

### Next Steps
- Fix nitpick
- Push changes
- Evaluate re-review overhead
- Make final decision on workflow adoption
