# Branch + PR Workflow Experiment

**Test**: PRD-32 Phase 3 on feature branch with CodeRabbit review

## Predicted Pros
- CodeRabbit catches bugs/issues
- Cleaner git history (one merge vs many commits)
- Practice for when we add collaborators
- Safer main branch

## Predicted Cons
- Extra time/overhead
- Journal generation complications
- AI reviewing AI code might be noisy
- Workflow friction for solo dev

## After Experiment
(We'll revisit this and see what actually happened)
