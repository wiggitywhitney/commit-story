# Understanding Services in Observability Architecture

## Core Definition of a Service

A **service** is an **independently deployable unit** that:
1. **Runs in its own process** (or container/VM/serverless function)
2. **Communicates over a network** (HTTP, gRPC, message queues, etc.)
3. **Has its own lifecycle** (can be started, stopped, scaled independently)
4. **Owns its resources** (database connections, memory, configuration)

## Monolith vs Microservices in Observability

### Why `commit-story-dev` Appears as ONE Service

Your entire application:
- Runs in a **single Node.js process**
- All functions share the **same memory space**
- Functions call each other **directly** (not over network)
- One `npm start` launches **everything**
- If one function crashes, **all crash**

### What Would Create Multiple Services in Service Map

To have multiple services visible in Datadog's Service Map, you'd need:
```
commit-story-api (Process 1, Port 3000)
  └── Makes HTTP calls to →

summary-service (Process 2, Port 3001)
  └── Makes HTTP calls to →

dialogue-service (Process 3, Port 3002)
```

Each would:
- Run via separate `node` commands
- Have its own package.json
- Be deployable independently
- Communicate via HTTP/gRPC, not function calls

## Code Example: Monolith vs Microservices

### Monolith Architecture (Current commit-story)
```javascript
// All in one process - direct function calls
async function generateJournal() {
  const summary = await generateSummary();  // Direct function call
  const dialogue = await generateDialogue(); // Same memory space
  return { summary, dialogue };
}
```

### Microservices Architecture
```javascript
// Each in different processes/containers - network calls
async function generateJournal() {
  const summary = await fetch('http://summary-service/generate');  // Network call
  const dialogue = await fetch('http://dialogue-service/generate'); // Network call
  return { 
    summary: await summary.json(), 
    dialogue: await dialogue.json() 
  };
}
```

## OpenTelemetry Service Configuration

Services are defined when initializing the OpenTelemetry SDK:
```javascript
const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: 'commit-story-dev',  // This becomes a "service" in Datadog
  spanProcessors: [...],
  instrumentations: [...]
});
```

## Achieving Function-Level Visibility in a Monolith

### Option 1: Flame Graph View (Recommended for Monoliths)
- Shows function calls as nested spans
- Great for timing and parent-child relationships
- Best view for understanding execution flow within a single service

### Option 2: Different Instrumentation Scopes
```javascript
// Use different tracers per component to distinguish in APM
const summaryTracer = trace.getTracer('commit-story.summary', '1.0.0');
const dialogueTracer = trace.getTracer('commit-story.dialogue', '1.0.0');
const decisionsTracer = trace.getTracer('commit-story.decisions', '1.0.0');
const contextTracer = trace.getTracer('commit-story.context', '1.0.0');
```

### Option 3: Pseudo-Services with Span Attributes
```javascript
// Add service-like tags to spans (not true services but helps with filtering)
span.setAttributes({
  'component': 'summary-generator',
  'span.type': 'web',
  'resource.name': 'generateSummary'
});
```

## Expected Trace Hierarchy After Full Instrumentation

Once DD-006 and DD-007 are implemented, traces will show:
```
commit-story-dev (main service)
  ├── context.gather-for-commit
  │   └── context.filter-messages
  ├── journal.generate-entry
  │   ├── summary.generate → api.openai.com
  │   ├── dialogue.generate → api.openai.com  
  │   └── technical-decisions.generate → api.openai.com
  └── [other operations]
```

## Why Service Map Shows Limited Information

The Datadog Service Map is optimized for showing:
- **Inter-service communication** (between different processes)
- **Network dependencies** (HTTP, database, cache connections)
- **Service health metrics** (latency, errors, throughput)

For a monolithic application:
- All functions appear under one service box
- External dependencies (like `api.openai.com`) appear as separate services
- Function-to-function flow is better visualized in **Flame Graph** or **Span List** views

## Restaurant Analogy

**Monolith**: 
- One chef doing appetizers, mains, and desserts
- All in the same kitchen
- Direct handoffs, shared equipment

**Microservices**: 
- Separate stations with different chefs
- Different kitchens/locations
- Orders passed via waiters (network)

In observability terms:
- The monolith chef is ONE service
- The microservices setup would be MULTIPLE services
- Datadog Service Map shows relationships between kitchens, not between cooking steps

## Key Takeaway

Your `commit-story` application is architecturally a **monolith** (one service), which is perfectly fine for its use case. The lack of multiple services in the Service Map isn't a problem to solve - it's an accurate representation of your architecture. Focus on:

1. **Complete span instrumentation** for visibility
2. **Flame Graph views** for execution flow
3. **Span analytics** for performance insights
4. **Custom dashboards** for business metrics

The Service Map becomes more valuable when you have actual service-to-service communication to monitor.

## Deciding When to Extract Microservices

### The Core Trade-off

**Monoliths**: Optimize for **simplicity** and **development speed**
**Microservices**: Optimize for **independent scalability** and **team autonomy**

### When to Keep Things Monolithic

#### 1. Early Stage / Small Teams
- You have < 10-20 developers
- Product requirements are still evolving rapidly
- You need to iterate quickly
- **Example**: A startup's MVP should almost always be a monolith

#### 2. High Data Consistency Needs
- Operations that need ACID transactions across multiple entities
- Complex business logic requiring shared state
- **Example**: Banking core ledger, e-commerce checkout flow

#### 3. Low Traffic / Uniform Scaling
- All parts of your app have similar load patterns
- You don't need to scale different parts independently
- **Example**: Internal admin tools, B2B SaaS with hundreds of customers

### When to Spin Out Microservices

#### 1. Different Scaling Requirements
- One part needs 100 servers, another needs 2
- **Example**: Netflix's video encoding (CPU-intensive) vs. user preferences (simple database lookups)

#### 2. Different Technology Requirements
- Need Python for ML, Go for performance, Node.js for real-time
- **Example**: Uber's routing engine (C++) vs. API gateway (Node.js)

#### 3. Team Boundaries
- Different teams own different business domains
- Teams want to deploy independently
- **Example**: Amazon's "two-pizza teams" - each team owns their service

#### 4. Different Release Cycles
- Payment processing (changes quarterly) vs. UI (changes daily)
- Regulatory compliance areas vs. experimental features
- **Example**: Healthcare billing service vs. patient portal

#### 5. Fault Isolation
- One component's failure shouldn't take down everything
- **Example**: Netflix's recommendation engine failure doesn't stop video playback

#### 6. Different Security/Compliance Requirements
- PCI compliance for payments
- HIPAA for health data
- **Example**: Separate service for handling credit cards

### The "Extraction Triggers" - Signs It's Time

#### Technical Triggers:
- **Performance**: "This one function uses 80% of our CPU"
- **Database**: "This table has 100x more writes than everything else"
- **Dependencies**: "We need Elasticsearch for search but not elsewhere"
- **Language**: "This ML model needs Python but everything else is Java"

#### Organizational Triggers:
- **Team friction**: "We can't deploy because Team B isn't ready"
- **Ownership**: "No one knows who owns this code"
- **Hiring**: "We need Rust experts just for this one component"

#### Business Triggers:
- **Vendor requirement**: "This needs to run on-premise at customer sites"
- **Acquisition**: "We bought a company and need to integrate their system"
- **Regulation**: "EU data must stay in EU servers"

### Common Extraction Patterns

#### 1. Edge Services First
Start with services at the system boundary:
- Authentication service
- Email/notification service  
- File upload/storage service

#### 2. Async Workers
Background jobs are easy to extract:
- Report generation
- Data export/import
- Video transcoding

#### 3. Third-Party Wrappers
Abstract external dependencies:
- Payment processing
- SMS sending
- AI/ML model serving

### The "Monolith First" Approach

Martin Fowler's advice:
1. **Start with a monolith**
2. **Find the natural boundaries through experience**
3. **Extract services when you feel the pain**
4. **Don't guess - wait for real problems**

### Real-World Example: Shopify

Shopify ran a massive Ruby on Rails monolith for years:
- **Kept monolithic**: Core commerce logic, checkout flow
- **Extracted**: Storefront rendering (high traffic, different scaling)
- **Extracted**: Analytics pipeline (different technology needs)
- **Extracted**: Background job processing (async, different failure modes)

### For Your Commit-Story App

Should remain monolithic because:
- Single developer/small team
- All components scale together
- Shared context (git data) across all generators
- No team boundaries
- Simple deployment story

You'd consider extraction if:
- You wanted to offer summary generation as a separate API service
- Different AI providers required different infrastructure
- You had millions of users and journal generation became a bottleneck

### The Cost of Getting It Wrong

#### Premature Microservices ("Microservice Envy"):
- Distributed system complexity with startup-size team
- 10x more code for service communication than business logic
- "We spent 6 months building a service mesh for our 100 users"

#### Overgrown Monolith ("Big Ball of Mud"):
- 2-hour test suites
- Can't deploy without 5 team coordination
- One bug takes down everything

### The Sweet Spot

Most successful organizations:
1. Start monolithic
2. Extract 3-7 key services when pain points emerge
3. Keep core business logic monolithic
4. Only go "full microservices" if you're Netflix/Amazon scale

The question isn't "microservices or monolith?" but "which parts should be services, and when?"
