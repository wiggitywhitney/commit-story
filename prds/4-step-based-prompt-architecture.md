# PRD-4: Step-Based Prompt Architecture for Section Generators

**GitHub Issue**: [#4](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/4)
**Status**: In Progress - Milestones 1-3 Complete
**Created**: 2025-09-05
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03  

## Summary

Restructure all three section generator prompts (Technical Decisions, Summary, and Dialogue) to follow the successful step-based pattern used in `/prd-create`, `/prd-next`, and `/prd-update-decisions` commands. The current prompts suffer from format-first antipatterns that cause AI to skip critical analysis steps, resulting in lower quality outputs.

## Problem Statement

Analysis of existing prompts reveals a clear effectiveness gap:

### Successful Pattern (Command Prompts)
- `/prd-create`, `/prd-next`, `/prd-update-decisions` all work reliably
- Clear numbered steps executed sequentially  
- Progressive information disclosure (format revealed last)
- Built-in verification steps

### Problem Pattern (Section Generator Prompts)
- **Technical Decisions Prompt**: Shows output format at line 13-20 BEFORE analysis steps
- **Summary Prompt**: Has competing principles that dilute clear process flow
- **Dialogue Prompt**: Format examples appear mid-prompt (line 77-82); anti-hallucination rules buried as appendix
- **Result**: AI pattern-matches to format rather than deeply analyzing content

## Success Criteria

1. **Output Quality**: Restructured prompts produce equivalent or better results than current prompts
2. **Consistency**: All three prompts follow the same successful step-based pattern
3. **Safety**: No critical functionality lost during restructuring
4. **Validation**: Before/after testing confirms improvement across diverse commit types

## What Makes Successful Prompts Work

Based on analysis of `/prd-create`, `/prd-next`, and `/prd-update-decisions`:

### 1. Sequential Steps with Clear Numbers
- Each step has a clear number and title
- Steps build on previous ones  
- No jumping ahead possible

### 2. Progressive Information Disclosure
- Context gathering first (Steps 1-2)
- Analysis middle (Steps 3-5)
- Output format ONLY at the end (Step 6+)

### 3. Decision Branches Within Steps
- "If context is clear: Skip to Step 6"
- "If YES: Note in the DD text"  
- Clear conditional logic

### 4. Verification Before Output
- `/prd-update-decisions` has Step 7: "Implementation Status Assessment"
- `/prd-next` has Step 5: "Quality check before final output"
- Always verify before generating

### 5. Format Examples at the Very End
- Output format specifications come AFTER all thinking
- Examples shown only after process is complete
- Prevents premature pattern matching

### 6. Essential Introductory Context
- Successful prompts include problem framing before steps
- "Overall Goal" and strategy context help AI understand purpose
- This is NOT competing principles - it's necessary context setting
- Steps come after context, not instead of it

## Implementation Plan

### Milestone 1: Technical Decisions Prompt Restructuring (3-4 hours) ✅ COMPLETE

#### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current prompt (identify what's worth keeping)
- [x] Restructure with proper step-based architecture
- [x] Move format specifications to final step (currently at lines 13-20)
- [x] Integrate anti-hallucination rules into relevant steps (not appendix)
- [x] Add verification step before output generation
- [x] Test before/after on 3-5 diverse commits
- [x] Present side-by-side comparison for human approval
- [x] Update `src/generators/prompts/sections/technical-decisions-prompt.js`

#### Proposed Structure (to be refined during implementation)
- **Step 1**: Analyze chat for technical discussions
- **Step 2**: Analyze git diff for file changes
- **Step 3**: Classify files (documentation vs functional)
- **Step 4**: Match discussions to file changes
- **Step 5**: Verify classification accuracy
- **Step 6**: Format output (ONLY NOW reveal bullet format)

### Milestone 2: Fix Dialogue Generation Timeout (1-2 hours) ✅ COMPLETE

**Context**: Dialogue generation started timing out at 60 seconds after recent changes. Commit a36d3800 (174 messages, 1 session) consistently fails dialogue generation but succeeds for summary and technical decisions.

#### Investigation Tasks
- [x] Identify root cause of timeout (likely candidates):
  - Recent session grouping changes affecting large chat sessions
  - Context description changes in dialogue-prompt.js
  - Context description prompt helper in `src/integrators/context-integrator.js`
  - Increased token count from session formatting
- [x] Test commit a36d3800 specifically (this is the breaking commit)
- [x] Compare token counts: dialogue vs summary/technical-decisions prompts
- [x] Review recent changes to `src/utils/session-formatter.js`
- [x] Review recent changes to `src/generators/dialogue-generator.js`
- [x] Review context description generation in `src/integrators/context-integrator.js`

#### Fix Tasks
- [x] Implement solution based on root cause analysis
- [x] Test fix on a36d3800 (must complete within 60s)
- [x] Test fix on 2-3 additional commits with varying session sizes
- [x] Verify dialogue quality remains equivalent

#### Success Criteria
- Dialogue generation completes within 60 seconds for a36d3800
- No quality degradation in dialogue extraction
- Solution scales to commits with multiple sessions and high message counts

### Milestone 3: Dialogue Prompt Restructuring (2-3 hours) ✅ COMPLETE

#### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current prompt (identify specific issues)
- [x] Move format examples to very end (currently at line 77-82)
- [x] Integrate anti-hallucination rules into Steps 2-3 (not appendix)
- [x] Replace introductory context with journalist role-based framing
- [x] Ensure true progressive disclosure throughout
- [x] Test before/after on same 3-5 commits from previous milestones
- [x] Present side-by-side comparison for human approval
- [x] Update `src/generators/prompts/sections/dialogue-prompt.js`

#### Key Principle
The dialogue prompt's introductory context is ESSENTIAL and should be preserved. Each AI instance needs to understand:
- The problem it's solving (extracting authentic dialogue)
- The strategy to use (summary-guided approach)
- Why quality matters (foundation of entire journal)

This framing is not "competing principles" - it's necessary context before steps begin.

### Milestone 4: Summary Prompt Restructuring (3-4 hours)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current prompt (identify what's worth keeping)
- [ ] Restructure with proper step-based architecture
- [ ] Move format specifications to final step
- [ ] Integrate authenticity principles into relevant steps (not scattered)
- [ ] Add verification step before output generation
- [ ] Test before/after on same 3-5 commits from Milestone 1
- [ ] Present side-by-side comparison for human approval
- [ ] Update `src/generators/prompts/sections/summary-prompt.js`

#### Proposed Structure (to be refined during implementation)
- **Step 1**: Analyze code changes in diff
- **Step 2**: Find related discussions in chat
- **Step 3**: Identify significance level
- **Step 4**: Match tone to actual work
- **Step 5**: Verify authenticity
- **Step 6**: Generate prose output (ONLY NOW reveal format)

## Technical Decisions

### DD-001: Sequential Step Architecture
**Decision**: Restructure all three prompts to use numbered steps that must be completed sequentially
**Rationale**: Prevents AI from jumping ahead to format generation before completing analysis
**Impact**: Major structural change requiring complete prompt rewrite
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - See Milestones 1-3 tasks

### DD-002: Progressive Disclosure Pattern
**Decision**: Move all format specifications to the final step after analysis is complete
**Rationale**: Format-first patterns cause premature pattern matching instead of deep analysis
**Impact**: Requires reorganizing all output formatting instructions
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - See Milestones 1-3 tasks

### DD-003: Mandatory Human Approval Testing
**Decision**: Require side-by-side before/after comparison with human approval before each prompt implementation
**Rationale**: Changes to core generation logic are high-risk; quality must be verified
**Impact**: Extends timeline but ensures quality preservation
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - Each milestone has testing task

### DD-004: Eliminate Waterfall Analysis Phase (2025-10-02)
**Decision**: Remove separate analysis milestones - integrate analysis into each prompt's restructuring work
**Rationale**: Upfront design documentation is makework; analysis happens naturally during restructuring
**Impact**: Reduces total effort from 11-16 hours to 8-11 hours; three focused milestones instead of four bloated ones
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - PRD structure updated per this decision

### DD-005: Include Dialogue Prompt Refinement (2025-10-02)
**Decision**: Add Milestone 3 to refine dialogue prompt despite it being "close enough" to the pattern
**Rationale**: All three prompts should follow identical architectural standards for consistency
**Impact**: Adds 2-3 hours to project scope but ensures uniform quality
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - See Milestone 3 tasks

### DD-006: Preserve Essential Introductory Context (2025-10-02)
**Decision**: Keep "Overall Goal" and strategy framing in prompts; this is necessary context, not competing principles
**Rationale**: Each AI instance needs problem framing before executing steps; successful command prompts use this pattern
**Impact**: Prevents over-correction that would remove valuable context
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Documented in Milestone 3 "Key Principle"

### DD-007: Increase AI Generator Timeouts (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Increase timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds for all three generators (dialogue, summary, technical decisions)
**Rationale**: Large chat sessions (174+ messages) were timing out at 30 seconds; 60 seconds provides better buffer
**Impact**: Allows generators to handle larger sessions without timeout failures
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Updated in commit 6dfa95e5
**Files**: src/generators/dialogue-generator.js, src/generators/summary-generator.js, src/generators/technical-decisions-generator.js

### DD-008: Fix Session Grouping Filtering Bypass (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Fix filtering bypass introduced by session grouping changes rather than adding new filtering logic
**Rationale**: Session grouping change in commit 8db5ceb4 bypassed existing message filtering, causing generators to receive unfiltered messages (448) instead of filtered subset (174); this caused dialogue generator timeout
**Impact**: Restored proper filtering order in context-integrator.js; filtering now happens after session grouping to maintain message integrity
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Updated in commit 600ed651
**Files**: src/integrators/context-integrator.js
**Verification**: Telemetry traces confirmed fix - generators now receive 175 filtered messages vs 448 unfiltered

### DD-009: Dynamic MaxQuotes Calculation (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Implement dynamic maxQuotes calculation using 8% formula: `Math.ceil(userMessages.overTwentyCharacters * 0.08) + 1`
**Rationale**: Fixed quote cap (25 or 3-8) doesn't scale with session size; large sessions get too few quotes, small sessions get too many
**Impact**: Quote cap now scales intelligently (174 messages → 15 quotes, 80 messages → 8 quotes, 50 messages → 5 quotes)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Updated in dialogue-generator.js
**Files**: src/generators/dialogue-generator.js

### DD-010: Journalist Role-Based Framing (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Replace abstract "Overall Goal" context with concrete journalist role and metaphor throughout dialogue prompt
**Rationale**: Journalist role provides clear mental model for quote selection quality, ethics (verbatim extraction, fact-checking), and output purpose
**Impact**: All 8 steps now use journalist framing ("your article", "your readers", "misquoting someone is not acceptable", "career suicide")
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Updated in dialogue-prompt.js
**Files**: src/generators/prompts/sections/dialogue-prompt.js

### DD-011: Conversation Grouping Emphasis (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Emphasize Human-Assistant exchange grouping in 3 places: Step 6 instruction, Step 7 verification, Step 8 formatting
**Rationale**: Original prompt didn't make exchange grouping clear, resulting in scattered quotes without conversational context
**Impact**: Human quotes now stay grouped with AI responses as single conversational units with proper blank line spacing
**Status**: ✅ Implemented - Updated in dialogue-prompt.js

### DD-012: Summary Prompt Role Framing - "Developer Explaining to Mentor" (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Adopt "developer explaining work to a trusted mentor" as the role framing for summary prompt
**Rationale**:
- Complements existing roles (Journalist for Dialogue, Code Archivist for Technical Decisions)
- Mentor framing naturally enforces: honesty over polish, impact over activity, learning over perfection, clarity over completeness
- Creates constraint to respect reader's time (get to the point)
- Encourages genuine reflection on weaknesses/pivots without performance theater
**Impact**: Will guide summary prompt restructuring in Milestone 4
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - See Milestone 4 tasks

### DD-054: Summary Prompt 4-Scenario Conditional Logic (2025-10-04)
**Decision**: Implement 4 distinct prompt scenarios based on commit content and chat presence
**Rationale**: Different types of commits need different guidance - routine doc updates should be brief, complex features need detailed narratives
**Scenarios**:
1. Code + Chat: Full mentor framing, explain what and why
2. Code + No Chat: Brief factual description only
3. No Code + Chat: Focus on discussions/planning
4. No Code + No Chat: Routine update framing, 1-2 sentences
**Impact**: Dramatically improved brevity for simple commits while maintaining detail for complex work
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Files**: src/generators/prompts/sections/summary-prompt-new.js, src/generators/summary-generator.js

### DD-055: Commit Content Analyzer Utility (2025-10-04)
**Decision**: Extract commit content analysis into shared utility for DRY principle
**Rationale**: Both summary and technical-decisions generators need to categorize files as functional vs documentation
**Impact**: Eliminated code duplication, provides consistent categorization with telemetry
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Files**: src/generators/utils/commit-content-analyzer.js, src/generators/technical-decisions-generator.js, src/generators/summary-generator.js

### DD-056: Chat Threshold Alignment (2025-10-04)
**Decision**: Use `>= 3 substantial messages` threshold for summary conditional logic
**Rationale**: Aligns with dialogue generator's behavior - 2 messages isn't enough for meaningful discussion
**Impact**: Prevents over-elaboration on commits with minimal interaction
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Files**: src/generators/summary-generator.js

### DD-013: Summary Quality Research Findings (2025-10-03)
**Decision**: Document analysis of recent summary outputs (Oct 1-3, 2025) to inform Milestone 4 restructuring
**Rationale**: Research identified strengths to preserve and shortcomings to address:

**Strengths to Preserve**:
- Strong narrative flow (beginning → middle → end)
- Technical depth with context (numbers explained, not just stated)
- Decision documentation (captures *why* not just *what*)
- Problem-solution structure

**Shortcomings to Address**:
- Verbosity & repetition (avoid restating what's in other sections)
- Missing "So What?" early (lead with impact, not "During this development session...")
- Chronological blow-by-blow vs. thematic organization
- Inconsistent detail level (meta commits too verbose, bug fixes appropriately detailed)

**Impact**: Research findings will inform step-based architecture during Milestone 4 implementation
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - To be applied during Milestone 4

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Testing requires access to diverse historical commits
- Each milestone builds on lessons from previous milestone (test on same commits for consistency)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Quality Regression
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Mandatory before/after testing with human approval on diverse commit types (each milestone)

### Risk: Lost Functionality
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Analysis integrated into restructuring work; preserve anti-hallucination rules and critical instructions

### Risk: Over-Engineering
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Follow existing successful patterns exactly; don't invent new approaches

### Risk: Analysis Paralysis
**Likelihood**: Medium (eliminated by DD-004)
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: No upfront design phase; learn by doing during each milestone

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-04: Milestone 4 Implementation Complete - Summary Prompt Restructured

- d16566e (Scenario 1): Detailed narrative for major feature work ✅
- d986749 (Scenario 3): Focus on discussions/planning decisions ✅
- 0850905 (Scenario 1): WIP milestone appropriately detailed ✅

**Technical Decisions**:
- DD-054: 4-Scenario Conditional Logic
- DD-055: Commit Content Analyzer Utility (DRY)
- DD-056: Chat Threshold Alignment (>= 3 messages)

**Remaining Tasks**:
- Present formal before/after comparison for human approval
- Activate new prompt by updating production file

**Next Steps**: Obtain formal approval and activate summary-prompt-new.js as production prompt

### 2025-10-03 (Afternoon): Milestone 3 Complete - Dialogue Prompt Restructured
**Duration**: ~5 hours
**Commits**: Multiple iterations during development, final commit pending

**Completed Work**:
- [x] Analyzed current dialogue prompt and identified issues: fabrication/misattribution (a36d3800), duplication (6fefb2af)
- [x] Restructured prompt with 8-step progressive disclosure architecture following technical decisions pattern
- [x] Moved format examples to Step 8 (final step only)
- [x] Integrated anti-hallucination rules into Steps 2, 5, 7 (CRITICAL attribution warnings, verification checks)
- [x] Replaced abstract context with journalist role-based framing throughout all steps
- [x] Implemented dynamic maxQuotes calculation (8% formula) in dialogue-generator.js
- [x] Tested on 4 commits from Oct 1-3 after regenerating journal entries
- [x] Presented side-by-side comparison for evaluation
- [x] Updated dialogue-prompt.js (old backed up to dialogue-prompt-old.js)

**Key Improvements**:
- **Journalist metaphor**: "You are a journalist writing about this development session. The summary is your article - already written"
- **Progressive disclosure**: Steps build sequentially (understand → find ALL → remove boring → narrow to best → verify → add context → quality check → format)
- **Dynamic scaling**: Quote cap adjusts to session size (8% formula produces 15 quotes for 174 messages, 8 for 80 messages)
- **Conversation grouping**: Emphasized in 3 places to keep Human-Assistant exchanges together as conversational units
- **Anti-hallucination**: "Misquoting someone is not acceptable", "Mishandling quotes is career suicide", triple verification (Steps 5, 7)
- **Summary alignment**: Step 7 verification ensures every quote supports the story told in summary

**Testing Results**:
- Commit 53dbcdb (Oct 1): 4 human quotes - quality over quantity working correctly
- Commit cf36c06 (Sep 30): 8 human quotes - exactly on target for session size
- Commit a36d380 (Oct 3): 8 human quotes - fabrication issue resolved
- Commit 600ed65 (Oct 3): 7 human quotes - scaling appropriately

**Design Decisions**:
- Backed up old prompt but activated new one for production use
- Kept maxQuotes dynamic but encouraged AI to "narrow significantly below {maxQuotes} if needed"
- Trusted AI intelligence over prescription - avoided scoring rubrics in favor of journalist judgment
- Fixed journal entry duplication system bug (Oct 2 had 17 entries, cleaned to 6 unique)

**Technical Decisions**:
- DD-009: Dynamic MaxQuotes Calculation (8% formula)
- DD-010: Journalist Role-Based Framing (throughout all steps)
- DD-011: Conversation Grouping Emphasis (3 reinforcement points)

**Future Consideration**:
- If dialogue quality degrades, consider implementing systematic quote scoring system (1-5 scale on interest, relevance, uniqueness)

**Next Session**: Begin Milestone 4 (Summary Prompt Restructuring)

### 2025-10-03 (Late Morning): Milestone 2 Complete - Dialogue Timeout Fixed
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Commits**: 600ed651 (fix: resolve session grouping filtering bypass and regenerate journals)

**Root Cause Identified**:
Session grouping changes in commit 8db5ceb4 inadvertently bypassed existing message filtering logic in context-integrator.js. Generators received 448 unfiltered messages instead of 174 filtered messages, causing dialogue generator to timeout due to intensive quote matching across excessive message pool.

**Fix Implementation**:
- Restored proper filtering order: filtering now happens AFTER session grouping to maintain message integrity
- Verified fix using OpenTelemetry traces:
  - Before: trace 8a9349bf showed 448 messages, dialogue timed out at 60s
  - After: trace 9bc445d5 showed 175 messages, all generators completed successfully

**Key Insight**:
AI initially proposed adding NEW filtering logic to context-integrator.js, which would have worked but masked the architectural bug. Human developer asked to examine trace data first, revealing existing filtering was being bypassed. This debugging approach prevented unnecessary code additions and fixed the root cause.

**Documentation**:
- Created blog/debugging-story-dialogue-timeout.md documenting telemetry-driven debugging approach
- Regenerated journal entries for all commits after 8db5ceb4 (the breaking commit)

**Technical Decisions**:
- DD-008: Fix Session Grouping Filtering Bypass (avoid adding duplicate filtering)

### 2025-10-03 (PM): Blocker Identified - Dialogue Generation Timeout
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Commits**: 6dfa95e5 (fix: concurrent export limit errors and increase AI timeouts)

**Issue Discovered**:
After completing Milestone 1 and implementing telemetry fixes, dialogue generation started timing out at 60 seconds for commit a36d3800 (174 messages, 1 session). Summary and technical decisions generators complete successfully for the same commit.

**Hypothesis**:
Recent changes to session grouping or context description generation may be causing increased token counts or processing time specifically for dialogue generation.

**Actions Taken**:
- Increased generator timeouts from 30s to 60s (partial mitigation, but timeout still occurs)
- Fixed concurrent export limit errors in logging system (separate issue)
- Added Milestone 2 as blocker before continuing with dialogue prompt restructuring

**Next Steps**:
- Work on Milestone 2 to investigate and fix dialogue timeout root cause
- Test fix on a36d3800 and other large session commits
- Continue with Milestone 3 (dialogue prompt restructuring) after blocker is resolved

### 2025-10-03 (AM): Milestone 1 Complete - Technical Decisions Prompt Restructured
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Commits**: Multiple commits during iterative development

**Completed Work**:
- [x] Analyzed current prompt and identified format-first antipattern as root cause
- [x] Restructured prompt with 5-step progressive disclosure architecture
- [x] Moved format specifications to Step 5 (final step only)
- [x] Integrated anti-hallucination rules into Step 4 ("Ensure every reason is traceable")
- [x] Added explicit output-only instruction to Step 5
- [x] Tested on 4 diverse commits (cf36c06, bbadf8d, 53dbcdb, 28f7a8f)
- [x] Presented side-by-side comparison and received approval
- [x] Updated technical-decisions-prompt.js (old backed up to technical-decisions-prompt-old.js)

**Additional Improvements**:
- Updated context-integrator.js with full data schemas for `git` and `chat_sessions` objects
- Renamed section to "Technical Decisions and Problem Solving"
- Added "Code Archivist" role-based framing to Step 1
- Refined filtering to explicitly exclude bug fixes
- Removed quotation marks from reasoning output
- Added explicit fallback to skip to Step 5 when no decisions found

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Accepted some noise in output for conference deadline - perfect filtering can be refined later
- IMPLEMENTED vs DISCUSSED classification working correctly based on file changes
- Progressive disclosure successfully prevents AI from showing intermediate steps

**Next Session**: Begin Milestone 2 (Summary Prompt Restructuring)

### 2025-10-02: Strategic Restructure of Implementation Plan
**Context**: During PRD-26 conference roadmap analysis, user questioned PRD-4's original structure

**Key Decisions**:
- Eliminated separate analysis milestone (DD-004) - integrate into each prompt's work
- Added dialogue prompt to scope (DD-005) - all three prompts should meet same standard
- Clarified essential introductory context (DD-006) - not competing principles, necessary framing
- Refined to three self-contained milestones: Technical Decisions (3-4h), Summary (3-4h), Dialogue (2-3h)

**Total Effort**: 8-11 hours (down from original 11-16 hours)

**Status**: PRD restructured, ready for implementation after PRD-24 (Package & Deploy) completes

## Future Considerations

This architecture pattern should be documented and applied to any future AI generator prompts to maintain consistency and quality across the system.
