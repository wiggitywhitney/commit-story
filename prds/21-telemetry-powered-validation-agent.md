# PRD-21: Telemetry-Powered Validation Agent

**GitHub Issue**: [#21](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/21)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: Medium
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Dependencies**: Datadog MCP server, commit-story telemetry infrastructure

## Executive Summary

Create an intelligent Claude Code agent that uses telemetry to validate that code changes produce expected runtime behavior by comparing before/after system metrics, detecting performance impacts, and identifying new error patterns introduced by changes.

## Context & Motivation

### Current State
Code validation relies on limited pre-deployment testing:
- Unit and integration tests cover known scenarios
- Performance testing happens in isolated environments
- Production behavior is only validated after deployment
- Regression detection is manual and reactive

### The Problem
Post-deployment validation is incomplete and delayed:
- **Validation Lag**: Problems discovered hours or days after deployment
- **Limited Coverage**: Tests miss real-world conditions and edge cases
- **Performance Blindness**: No visibility into actual performance impacts
- **Error Introduction**: New failure modes may not surface immediately

### Real Examples
- Code change deploys successfully but introduces 20% latency increase (invisible to tests)
- New error handling logic creates subtle bug under production load
- Database optimization reduces query time but increases memory usage
- Microservice change affects downstream systems in unexpected ways

### The Opportunity
Leverage runtime telemetry to provide **immediate validation feedback** that complements traditional testing with actual system behavior analysis.

## Success Criteria

1. **Fast Detection**: Identify performance regressions within 5 minutes of deployment
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Detect changes in performance, errors, and system behavior
3. **Actionable Feedback**: Provide specific validation results with confidence scores
4. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate into deployment and PRD workflows
5. **Regression Prevention**: Prevent performance and reliability regressions from reaching production

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Before/After Comparison
**Purpose**: Compare system behavior before and after code changes

**Capabilities**:
- Capture baseline telemetry before changes are deployed
- Measure same metrics after changes are live
- Statistical comparison to identify significant changes
- Timeline analysis to show change impact over time

#### 2. Performance Impact Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect performance regressions and improvements

**Capabilities**:
- Latency analysis (request/response times, database queries)
- Throughput measurement (requests per second, processing rates)
- Resource utilization changes (CPU, memory, network)
- Capacity impact assessment (load handling capabilities)

#### 3. Error Pattern Detection
**Purpose**: Identify new or changed error conditions

**Capabilities**:
- New error message detection in logs
- Error rate changes and statistical significance
- Error pattern analysis (frequency, distribution, severity)
- Cascade effect detection (errors propagating to other services)

#### 4. Behavioral Change Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect unexpected changes in system behavior

**Capabilities**:
- Service interaction pattern changes
- Data flow and processing changes
- User experience impact measurement
- External dependency interaction changes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Fast Analysis**: Complete validation analysis within 5 minutes
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Use proper statistical methods for change detection
- **Noise Filtering**: Distinguish meaningful changes from normal variance
- **Flexible Integration**: Support both manual and automated validation workflows
- **Clear Reporting**: Present findings in actionable, easy-to-understand format

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Interface
```
/validate [change-type] [timeframe] [options]
```

**Examples**:
- `/validate deployment --last 30m` - Validate recent deployment impact
- `/validate performance --compare 1h-ago` - Check performance changes in last hour
- `/validate errors --baseline yesterday` - Compare error patterns against yesterday
- `/validate --full-report --since commit-abc123` - Comprehensive validation since specific commit

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Datadog metrics, logs, traces via MCP server
- **Secondary**: Application performance metrics and custom instrumentation
- **Tertiary**: Infrastructure metrics and deployment events

### Analysis Engine
- Statistical change detection using appropriate statistical tests
- Time series analysis for trend identification
- Anomaly detection for identifying unusual patterns
- Machine learning for improving change significance detection

### Integration Points
- CI/CD pipelines for automatic post-deployment validation
- PRD workflows for change verification during implementation
- Development environments for pre-deployment validation
- Monitoring systems for alerting on validation failures

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| False positive regression alerts | Medium | Medium | Improve statistical methods and confidence scoring |
| Validation takes too long for CI/CD | Medium | High | Optimize analysis speed and provide early indicators |
| Missing subtle but important regressions | Medium | High | Comprehensive metric coverage and pattern analysis |
| Integration complexity with existing workflows | High | Medium | Design modular, optional integration points |
| Baseline data quality issues | Low | High | Robust baseline capture and validation mechanisms |

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Validation analysis time (target: <5 minutes)
- Regression detection accuracy (true/false positive rates)
- Integration adoption rate in development workflows
- Time-to-detection for performance/error regressions

### Qualitative
- Developer confidence in deployment decisions
- Reduced production incidents from undetected regressions
- Faster issue resolution when regressions are detected
- Better visibility into change impacts across the system

## Work Log

### 2025-09-21: PRD Creation
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Activities**:
- Created GitHub issue #21
- Drafted comprehensive PRD focusing on validation and regression detection
- Designed phased approach balancing automation and integration complexity
- Aligned with broader telemetry-driven development initiative

**Key Insights**:
- Validation agent has highest workflow integration potential
- Statistical rigor is critical for avoiding false positives/negatives
- Should complement rather than replace existing testing strategies
- Integration points should be flexible to support various development workflows

**Next Steps**:
- Review statistical analysis requirements and methods
- Begin Phase 1 implementation with basic before/after comparison
- Design integration patterns for common CI/CD and development workflows

## Open Questions

1. **Baseline Duration**: How long should baselines be captured for accurate comparison?
2. **Statistical Methods**: What's the appropriate statistical significance threshold for change detection?
3. **Integration Timing**: When in CI/CD pipeline should validation occur for optimal feedback?
4. **Rollback Integration**: Should agent automatically trigger rollbacks on critical regressions?
5. **Multi-Service Impact**: How to validate changes that affect multiple interconnected services?
