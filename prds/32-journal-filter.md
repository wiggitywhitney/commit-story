# PRD-32: Journal File Filtering

**Status**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS - Phase 5 (Validation) Next
**GitHub Issue**: [#32](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/32)
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21 (Phase 4 implementation complete)
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix before next release

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Completed**:
- ✅ Phase 0: Research & Investigation - Root cause identified
- ✅ Phase 1: Scope Definition - Filtering rules defined
- ✅ Phase 2: Hook-Level Prevention - Journal-entries-only commits skip hook
- ✅ Phase 3: Diff-Level Filtering - Journal entries filtered from git diffs
- ✅ Phase 4: Merge Commit Handling - Hybrid skip logic implemented

**Next**: Phase 5 (Validation) - comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Test all 4 merge commit scenarios with real-world merges
- Validate Phases 2-4 work correctly together
- Verify no context pollution or recursive generation issues

## Problem Statement

Journal entries are creating noise and recursive generation issues that degrade the quality of generated content:

### Problem 1: Recursive Journal Generation
When a commit only adds journal entries (e.g., commit `1104c468`), the post-commit hook triggers and generates another journal entry about adding a journal entry. This creates recursive noise and wastes tokens.

### Problem 2: Context Pollution from Git Diffs
When commits include changes to journal files alongside functional code changes, the git diff contains old journal content. This causes generators to reference outdated solutions and previous work that isn't relevant to the current commit.

**Example**: [journal/entries/2025-10/2025-10-17.md](../journal/entries/2025-10/2025-10-17.md) lines 48-83

Commit `441db893` (gitignore config file) contains this problematic text in its Summary section:

> "The session also covered the AGPL license change that had been committed previously, reinforcing the importance of including the license in the npm package due to legal requirements. This context helped shape the conversation around the config file and its relevance to different users of the project."

This is context bleed from the **previous commit** `b0b0c9b2` (license change). The AGPL license information has nothing to do with the gitignore commit, yet it appears in the generated summary.

**Key Insight**: Generator functions should know nothing about journal files. They exist as output artifacts, not as input context.

## Test Case

**Commit 1104c468**: A journal-only commit that demonstrates the recursive generation problem. This commit should NOT have triggered journal generation.

## Filtering Scope

**Filter these paths** (journal entries only):
- `journal/entries/**/*.md` - Auto-generated journal entries

**DO NOT filter these paths**:
- `journal/reflections/**/*.md` - Manual user reflections (should remain visible)
- `journal/context/**/*.md` - Manual context captures (should remain visible)
- `prds/**/*.md` - PRD documentation (not journal output)

**Rationale**: Only auto-generated journal entries create recursive/pollution problems. Manual reflections and context captures are intentional user input and should be treated like any other documentation.

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Commits that only touch `journal/entries/**` do NOT trigger the post-commit hook (Phase 2)
2. ✅ Files matching `journal/entries/**` are completely filtered from git diffs before being passed to any generator (Phase 3)
3. ✅ Old solutions and outdated context from previous journal entries no longer appear in new entries (Phase 3)
4. ✅ Manual reflections and context captures remain visible in git diffs and chat context (NOT filtered) (Phase 3)
5. ⏳ Merge commits do NOT trigger the post-commit hook (Phase 4 - IN PROGRESS)
6. ⏳ No dirty working tree after merge commits (Phase 4 - IN PROGRESS)
7. ⏳ Commit 1104c468 can be used to verify the fix (re-running it should produce no output) (Phase 5 validation)
8. ⏳ Commit 441db893 context bleed no longer occurs when regenerated (Phase 5 validation)

## Non-Goals

- This PRD does NOT apply to PRD files (they are documentation, not journal output)
- This does NOT filter manual user reflections from chat history or git diffs
- This does NOT filter context captures from chat history or git diffs
- This does NOT change how reflections or context captures work

## Implementation Phases

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Work Order**
- Phases 0-3: ✅ Complete
- Phase 4 (Merge Commit Handling): ⏳ NEXT - Do this first
- Phase 5 (Validation): ⏳ AFTER Phase 4 - Comprehensive testing including merge commits

### Phase 0: Research & Investigation
**Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Root cause identified (2025-10-17)

#### Investigation Summary

Comprehensive investigation using telemetry analysis, git history, code search, and Oct 3 reflection notes revealed the root cause and clarified confusion with unrelated PRD-2.

#### Key Findings

**Finding 1: Message Filtering Bypass (Oct 1-3, 2025) - UNRELATED to journal path filtering**
- ✅ **Oct 1** (commit `8db5ceb4`): Session grouping implementation bypassed message filtering
  - Generators switched from `chatMessages` (filtered) to `chatSessions` (unfiltered)
  - Result: 448 unfiltered messages instead of 174 filtered → dialogue timeouts
  - This broke filtering of tool calls, system messages, etc.
- ✅ **Oct 3** (commit `600ed65`): Message filtering was RESTORED
  - Applied filtering to session groups to match filtered flat messages
  - Verified with telemetry: 61% token reduction (448→174 messages)
- ✅ **Conclusion**: Message filtering working correctly now, NOT the root cause of journal entry problem

**Finding 2: Journal Path Filtering (NEVER IMPLEMENTED) - ROOT CAUSE**

**Evidence from comprehensive code search**:
- ✅ `git log -p -S "journal/entries"` → NO commits ever implemented path filtering
- ✅ `grep -r "journal/entries" src/` → Only references in `journal-paths.js` utility (path generation, not filtering)
- ✅ `src/collectors/git-collector.js:55` → Uses `git diff-tree -p ${commitRef}` with NO path exclusions
- ✅ `src/generators/filters/context-filter.js:136` → Only filters by:
  - Sensitive data redaction (`redactSensitiveData`)
  - Diff size (summarizes if >15000 tokens)
  - **NO path-based filtering**
- ✅ `src/generators/utils/commit-content-analyzer.js` → Categorizes docs vs functional files, but NO journal-specific logic
- ✅ `hooks/post-commit` → No journal commit detection
- ✅ `src/index.js` → No journal filtering at entry point

**Historical context that confused investigation**:
- ❌ **PRD-1 DD-029** (Sept 2025): "Journal Path Filtering Strategy (Deferred)"
  - This was about filtering **PRD files and task management docs** from journal generation
  - NOT about filtering journal entries themselves from git diffs
  - Correctly deferred pending configuration architecture
- ❌ **PRD-2** (Sept 2-Oct 12, 2025): File Exclusion System for Journal Noise Reduction
  - Also about filtering **PRDs/task management files**, not journal entries
  - Status changed to "Not Planning to Implement" on Oct 12
  - Completely separate concern from PRD-32

**Actual problem**: Journal entry path filtering for `journal/entries/**` was NEVER implemented.

**Finding 3: Timeline of Journal Entry Problem**

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| Aug 28, 2025 | `context-filter.js` created (commit `13ceb04`) | Token-based filtering only |
| Oct 1, 2025 | Session grouping (commit `8db5ceb4`) | Message filtering bypassed (unrelated) |
| Oct 3, 2025 | Filtering restored (commit `600ed65`) | Message filtering working again (unrelated) |
| Oct 7-8, 2025 | Journal directory created (commit `b676b55`) | `journal/entries/` structure established |
| Oct 15, 2025 | Recursive generation discovered (commit `1104c468`) | Journal-only commit triggered recursive generation |
| Oct 17, 2025 | Context bleed discovered (commit `441db893`) | Old journal content in diffs causing AI to reference previous work |

#### Answers to Key Questions

1. **Did journal entry path filtering exist before?**
   - NO - it was NEVER implemented
   - DD-029 and PRD-2 were about filtering PRDs/task files (different problem)

2. **What broke?**
   - Nothing broke - filtering never existed
   - Two issues discovered:
     - ✅ Message filtering bypass (Oct 1) → FIXED Oct 3 (unrelated)
     - ❌ Journal path filtering → NEVER EXISTED (this PRD)

3. **When did journal files start appearing in diffs?**
   - Always included since journal directory created (~Oct 7-8)
   - Problem became visible when:
     - Journal entries accumulated over time
     - Entries committed alongside code changes
     - Old journal content caused context bleed

#### Root Cause: Two Separate Problems

1. ✅ **Message filtering bypass** - ALREADY FIXED (commit `600ed65`)
   - Tool calls, system messages properly filtered now
   - Session grouping maintains filtering correctly

2. ❌ **Journal path filtering** - NEVER IMPLEMENTED (this PRD solves it)
   - Journal entry files always included in git diffs
   - `filterGitDiff()` only handles size/sensitivity, NOT paths
   - Need to implement path-based exclusion for `journal/entries/**`

#### Implementation Locations

**Phase 2** (Hook-Level Prevention):
- `hooks/post-commit` or `src/index.js:204-210`
- Detect journal-entry-only commits before context gathering
- Skip execution entirely if only `journal/entries/**` changed

**Phase 3** (Diff-Level Filtering):
- **Option A** (Preferred): `src/collectors/git-collector.js:55`
  - Add `-- . ':!journal/entries/**'` to `git diff-tree` command
  - Filters at collection time (most efficient)
- **Option B**: `src/generators/filters/context-filter.js:136`
  - Add path filtering logic to `filterGitDiff()` function
  - Parse diff and remove sections for `journal/entries/**` files
- `src/generators/utils/commit-content-analyzer.js:33-36`
  - Exclude `journal/entries/**` from `changedFiles` analysis

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
**Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Scope defined (see "Filtering Scope" section above)

**Filtering Rules** (Decided 2025-10-17):
- ✅ `journal/entries/**` - Filter these (auto-generated, creates recursive/pollution issues)
- ✅ `journal/reflections/**` - DO NOT filter (manual user input, intentional content)
- ✅ `journal/context/**` - DO NOT filter (manual context captures, intentional content)
- ✅ `prds/**` - DO NOT filter (documentation, not journal output)

**Rationale**: Only auto-generated journal entries need filtering. Manual reflections and context captures are intentional user documentation and should remain visible like any other code documentation.

**Next Phase**: Proceed directly to Phase 2 (Hook-Level Prevention)

### Phase 2: Hook-Level Prevention
**Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Prevent post-commit hook from running on journal-entry-only commits (2025-10-18)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Add commit analysis utility - Created `src/utils/commit-analyzer.js`
- [x] If commit only touches `journal/entries/**` paths, skip execution entirely
- [x] Test with commit 1104c468 (should skip - no hook execution) - ✅ PASSED
- [x] Test with mixed commits (journal entries + code changes - should still run) - ✅ PASSED
- [x] Test with reflections/context-only commits (should still run - these are manual content) - ✅ PASSED

**Implementation Location**: `src/index.js` (lines 205-213) and new `src/utils/commit-analyzer.js`

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `getChangedFilesInCommit()` - Uses `git diff-tree` to detect changed files
- Created `isJournalEntriesOnlyCommit()` - Pattern matches `journal/entries/**`
- Early exit check placed after CLI parsing, before expensive context collection
- Proper span closure and debug logging for observability

**Test Results**:
- Commit 1104c468 (historical journal-only): Successfully skipped
- Commit e5edb4d (3 journal entries): Successfully skipped
- Mixed commits (code + journal/reflection): Ran normally
- Code-only commits: Ran normally
- Reflection-only commits: Ran normally (manual content preserved)
- Context-only commits: Ran normally (manual content preserved)

### Phase 3: Diff-Level Filtering
**Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Strip journal entry files from git diffs before passing to generators (2025-10-18)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Add `journal/entries/**` filtering to git diff collection - Added git pathspec to git-collector.js
- [x] Update `commit-content-analyzer.js` to exclude `journal/entries/**` files from `changedFiles`
- [x] Ensure no generator receives journal entry file diffs - Double filtering implemented
- [x] Verify reflections and context files are NOT filtered - Test passed (commit f08eb69)

**Implementation Locations**:
- `src/collectors/git-collector.js` line 57 - Added git pathspec `:!journal/entries/`
- `src/generators/utils/commit-content-analyzer.js` lines 33-42 - Added file filter logic

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Git-level filtering**: Added pathspec to `git diff-tree` command for efficiency
- **Double filtering**: Both git-collector and commit-content-analyzer filter journal entries
- **Pattern matching**: Simple `!file.startsWith('journal/entries/')` check for clarity
- **Preservation**: Reflections and context captures explicitly not filtered

**Test Results**:
- **Test 1**: Mixed commit (b6e7ad1) - Journal entry filtered, only code visible ✅
- **Test 2**: Reflection commit (f08eb69) - Reflection file visible in journal ✅
- **Test 3**: Context bleed fix - Commit 441db893 regenerates cleanly, no AGPL pollution ✅

### Phase 4: Merge Commit Handling
**Goal**: ✅ COMPLETE - Eliminate git merge friction for mechanical merges while preserving context from merges with conflicts/decisions

**Status**: Implementation complete (2025-10-21) - Full validation pending production merge scenarios

**Problem**:
When merging branches, the post-commit hook fires after the merge commit completes, generating a journal entry. This leaves the working tree dirty (journal file modified), requiring a manual `git commit --amend` step. This creates friction in the merge workflow.

**Example friction**:
```bash
git merge feature-branch          # Creates merge commit
# Hook fires, generates journal entry
# Working tree now dirty
git add journal/... && git commit --amend  # Manual step required
```

**Solution - Hybrid Approach (per DD-016 v2)**:
Skip journal generation ONLY for merge commits that are both silent (no chat) AND clean (no diff). Generate journals for merges with AI conversation OR code changes (conflict resolution).

**Why Hybrid**:
- ✅ Eliminates friction for routine/mechanical merges (no chat AND no diff = no journal)
- ✅ Preserves conflict resolution context (chat OR diff = generate journal)
- ✅ Captures strategic merge decisions (discussions about WHEN/WHY to merge)
- ✅ Handles silent conflict resolutions (no chat but has diff = generate journal) - **DD-016 v2 improvement**
- ✅ Handles squash merges appropriately (chat OR diff = context preserved)
- ⚠️ Conservative: "any chat OR any diff → generate journal" prevents context loss

**Tasks**:
- [x] Research existing "substantial chat" filter threshold and implementation (see DD-016)
- [x] Detect merge commits (check for multiple parent commits using `git rev-list --parents`)
- [x] Check for chat activity during merge commit time window
- [x] Check for diff presence (any non-empty diff = meaningful changes, per DD-016 v2)
- [x] Skip journal generation ONLY if merge commit AND no chat messages AND no diff
- [x] Test merge workflows (DD-016 v2 test matrix):
  - [~] Clean merge with no chat, no diff (should skip) - **Deferred: requires production merge**
  - [x] Clean merge with chat, no diff (should generate - strategic discussion) - ✅ Tested with bb6a16f
  - [~] Merge with conflicts but no chat, has diff (should generate - silent conflict resolution) - **Deferred: requires production merge**
  - [~] Merge with conflict resolution conversation and diff (should generate) - **Deferred: requires production merge**
- [~] Update telemetry to track skip reasons - **Deferred: can be added later**

**Implementation Details**:
- **`src/utils/commit-analyzer.js`** (lines 40-76): Added `isMergeCommit()` function
  - Uses `git rev-list --parents -n 1` to detect commits with 2+ parents
  - Returns `{ isMerge: boolean, parentCount: number }`
  - Error-safe: returns false on git command failures
- **`src/index.js`** (lines 18, 222-239): Hybrid skip logic
  - Imports `isMergeCommit` from commit-analyzer
  - Checks merge status after context collection (needs chat/diff data)
  - Evaluates: `hasChat = context.chatMessages.data.length > 0`
  - Evaluates: `hasDiff = context.commit.data.diff.trim().length > 0`
  - Skips ONLY if `!hasChat && !hasDiff`
  - Debug logging shows merge detection and decision rationale

**Rationale (Updated DD-016 v2)**:
Merge commits without conflicts AND without chat are mechanical operations where the development story lives in individual commits. BUT merge commits with conflicts (visible via diff) OR strategic discussions (visible via chat) involve real development work that should be documented. Using BOTH chat activity and diff presence as signals for "significant merge work" prevents losing context from silent conflict resolutions.

### Phase 5: Validation
**Goal**: ⏳ NEXT - Verify the fix works end-to-end (including merge commit handling)

**Status**: Not started - complete this AFTER Phase 4 (Merge Commit Handling)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test journal-entry-only commit (e.g., 1104c468) - should skip hook execution entirely
- [ ] Test reflection-only or context-only commit - should still run hook (manual content)
- [ ] Test mixed commit with journal entries + code - should run but exclude journal entry diffs
- [ ] **Test merge commit scenarios (Phase 4 validation)**:
  - [ ] Silent merge (no chat activity) - should skip hook execution
  - [ ] Merge with chat activity - should generate journal with conflict resolution context
  - [ ] Verify no dirty working tree after silent merges
- [ ] Regenerate commit 441db893 and verify no AGPL license bleed in output
- [ ] Review recent journal entries to confirm no more "old solutions" pollution
- [ ] Check telemetry to verify filtering is working
- [ ] Verify reflections and context files remain visible in git diffs
- [ ] Verify telemetry shows merge skip reasons: `merge_no_chat` vs generated
- [ ] Update PRD with validation results

## Open Questions

1. **When did this break?** ⏳ TO BE ANSWERED in Phase 0 telemetry analysis
   - Was there previous logic that got removed?
   - What changed in the last 3 weeks?

2. ✅ **Manual reflections** - ANSWERED (2025-10-17)
   - Should `journal/reflections/**` be treated the same as `journal/entries/**`?
   - **Decision**: NO - Reflections are manual user input and should NOT be filtered

3. ✅ **Context captures** - ANSWERED (2025-10-17)
   - Should `journal/context/**` files be filtered from diffs?
   - **Decision**: NO - Context captures are manual user input and should NOT be filtered

4. ✅ **Chat vs Diff** - ANSWERED (2025-10-17)
   - Should journal filtering rules differ for chat history vs git diffs?
   - **Decision**: Only filter `journal/entries/**` from git diffs. Reflections and context in chat history should remain (they're manual user input)

## Design Decisions

### DD-016: Hybrid Merge Commit Handling - Skip Only Silent, Clean Merges
**Decision**: Skip journal generation for merge commits ONLY when there is BOTH no chat activity AND no diff (empty merge). Generate journals for merges with AI conversation OR code changes.
**Date**: 2025-10-18 (Updated 2025-10-19 with diff check)
**Status**: ⏳ Outstanding - Not yet implemented

**Problem Analysis**:
Initial approach was to skip ALL merge commits to eliminate workflow friction (dirty working tree after merge). However, this has significant drawbacks:

**Cons of Skipping All Merges**:
1. **Merge conflicts = real development work**
   - Developer makes decisions about conflict resolution
   - AI conversations guide resolution strategy
   - May involve writing NEW code that doesn't exist in either parent
   - Context is valuable for understanding WHY conflicts were resolved a certain way

2. **Strategic merge decisions**
   - Emergency hotfix merges (why merge incomplete work)
   - Integration testing insights discovered during merge
   - Decisions about WHEN to merge (timing matters)

3. **Squash merges**
   - `git merge --squash` makes feature branch commits disappear from history
   - Skipping the merge commit = losing ALL documentation of that work

4. **Integration insights**
   - Trade-offs made during complex integrations
   - Integration bugs discovered when combining features
   - Architectural insights from seeing how things fit together

**Evolution of Decision**:
1. **Original (DD-016 v1)**: Skip if no chat activity
2. **Problem identified (2025-10-19)**: What about silent conflict resolutions with meaningful code changes but no AI chat?
3. **Refined (DD-016 v2)**: Skip ONLY if no chat AND no diff

**Final Decision**: Use chat activity OR diff presence as signals for "significant merge work"

**Implementation Strategy**:
```javascript
if (isMergeCommit(commitRef)) {
  const hasChat = chatMessages.length > 0;
  const diff = getDiffForCommit(commitRef);
  const hasMeaningfulChanges = diff.trim().length > 0;

  // Skip ONLY if both no chat AND no changes
  if (!hasChat && !hasMeaningfulChanges) {
    return { shouldSkip: true, reason: 'merge_no_changes_no_chat' };
  }

  // Either chat OR changes = generate journal
  return { shouldSkip: false };
}
```

**Threshold Decisions**:

**Chat threshold**:
- Use LOWER threshold than existing "substantial chat" filter for dialogue section
- Dialogue filter skips section if chat not substantial (e.g., < 5 messages)
- Merge filter skips ENTIRE JOURNAL only if NO chat at all (0 messages)
- Rationale: Higher stakes for skipping entire journal vs skipping one section

**Diff threshold (DD-016 v2, 2025-10-19)**:
- **Decision**: Any non-empty diff triggers journal generation
- **Rationale for merge commits**: Diff shows ONLY conflict resolution/integration code (not all feature branch changes)
  - Empty diff = completely clean merge (git auto-resolved everything)
  - Any non-empty diff = conflicts resolved OR manual integration code written
  - Even 1 line changed in merge commit is usually meaningful
- **Rejected alternatives**:
  - Line threshold (5-10 lines): Arbitrary, might skip meaningful small conflicts
  - Character threshold (50-100 chars): Also arbitrary, complex to tune
  - "Any diff" is simplest boolean check and most conservative

**Research Required**:
- [ ] Investigate existing "substantial chat" filter implementation
- [ ] Understand threshold and logic for what makes chat "substantial"
- [ ] Find where it's used (likely in dialogue generator)
- [ ] Check metrics: `commit_story.dialogue.substantial_user_messages`
- [ ] Determine if we should reuse that logic or create simpler "any chat" check

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminates friction for routine merges (90% case: clean merge, no chat)
- ✅ Preserves conflict resolution context (10% case: conflicts, chat happened)
- ✅ Conservative approach prevents context loss
- ✅ Handles edge cases well (squash merges with chat = context exists)

**Edge Cases Handled (Updated with DD-016 v2)**:
1. **Silent conflict resolution with code changes** (no chat, has diff) → **Generate** ✅ (DD-016 v2 fix)
2. **Clean merge with chat** (has chat, no diff) → **Generate** (strategic discussion documented)
3. **Clean merge, no chat** (no chat, no diff) → **Skip** (truly mechanical merge)
4. **Pre-merge planning** (chat before merge, not during) → **Skip merge** (but feature commits have journals)
5. **Post-merge fixes** (problems found after merge) → **Skip merge**, generate journal for fix commit
6. **Squash merges with chat** → **Generate** (context preserved)
7. **Squash merges with diff but no chat** → **Generate** (conflict resolution preserved)
8. **Octopus merges** (3+ parents) → **Generate if chat OR diff**, skip if silent and clean

**Impact on Phases**:
- Phase 4 Task 1: Research substantial chat filter
- Phase 4 implementation: Check chat messages AND diff before skipping (DD-016 v2)
- Phase 5 validation: Test multiple merge scenarios (silent clean, silent with conflicts, chatty clean, chatty with conflicts)

## Work Log

### 2025-10-21: Phase 4 Implementation Complete
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Branch**: feature/prd-32-phase-4-merge-commit-handling
**Focus**: Implementing hybrid merge commit detection and skip logic per DD-016 v2

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Researched existing "substantial chat" filter implementations
  - Found thresholds: summary-generator (>=3 messages), dialogue-generator (>=1 message)
  - Decided: Use simpler "any chat" (>0 messages) for merge detection
- [x] Implemented `isMergeCommit()` function in commit-analyzer.js:40-76
  - Uses `git rev-list --parents -n 1` to detect commits with 2+ parents
  - Returns `{ isMerge: boolean, parentCount: number }`
  - Error-safe: defaults to allowing execution on failures
- [x] Implemented hybrid skip logic in index.js:222-239
  - Imports and calls `isMergeCommit()` after context collection
  - Checks `hasChat = context.chatMessages.data.length > 0`
  - Checks `hasDiff = context.commit.data.diff.trim().length > 0`
  - Skips ONLY if `!hasChat && !hasDiff`
  - Includes debug logging for merge detection and decisions
- [x] Initial testing with existing merge commit bb6a16f
  - Correctly identified as merge commit (2 parents)
  - Correctly generated journal (has 113 chat messages, clean merge)
  - Validates Scenario 2: "Clean merge with chat, no diff → Generate"

**Implementation Notes**:
- Telemetry deferred per user request (can be added separately later)
- Full 4-scenario test matrix requires real-world merges to complete validation
- Phase 3 journal filtering integrates correctly with Phase 4 merge detection
- Filtered diff (excluding journal/entries/**) is appropriate for merge commit checks

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Scenario 2 tested: Clean merge with chat → Generates journal correctly
- ⏳ Scenario 1 pending: Clean merge without chat → Should skip (needs real merge)
- ⏳ Scenario 3 pending: Merge with conflicts, no chat → Should generate (needs real merge)
- ⏳ Scenario 4 pending: Merge with conflicts and chat → Should generate (needs real merge)

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 5 validation with comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Real-world merge scenarios will naturally validate remaining test cases
- Consider adding telemetry for merge skip reasons once logic is validated

**Additional Work Done**:
- [x] Fixed security vulnerability (command injection) in commit-analyzer.js
  - Added input validation to `isMergeCommit()` and `getChangedFilesInCommit()`
  - Validates commitRef format: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]+$/`
  - Returns safe defaults on invalid input
- [x] Updated README.md with "Journal Management" section
  - Documents default .gitignore behavior and tradeoffs
  - Explains merge commit behavior when journals are tracked
  - Clarifies that journals persist locally across branches when ignored
  - Provides workaround for merge commits with conflicts (manual amend)

### 2025-10-19: DD-016 v2 - Refined Merge Commit Strategy with Diff Check
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Commits**: None (design refinement)
**Focus**: Adding diff presence check to DD-016 to handle silent conflict resolutions

**Problem Identified**:
User asked: "Would a merge commit with a meaningful code diff but not much chat be worth making an entry about?"

**Key Insight**:
Original DD-016 would skip merge commits with no chat, even if they had significant conflict resolution code changes. This would lose valuable context from silent conflict resolutions.

**Design Refinement (DD-016 v2)**:
- **v1 logic**: Skip if no chat
- **v2 logic**: Skip ONLY if no chat AND no diff
- **Rationale**: For merge commits, diff shows ONLY conflict resolution/integration code (not all feature branch changes)
  - Empty diff = clean merge (git auto-resolved)
  - Any non-empty diff = conflicts manually resolved
  - Even 1-line diff in merge is usually meaningful

**Threshold Discussion**:
- Considered: line count (5-10), character count (50-100), "any diff"
- **Decision**: "Any non-empty diff" (simplest, most conservative)
- Rejected line/character thresholds as arbitrary

**Updated Implementation**:
```javascript
// Skip ONLY if BOTH conditions true
if (!hasChat && !hasMeaningfulChanges) {
  skip();
}
// Either chat OR diff = generate
```

**Updated Test Matrix**:
1. Clean merge, no chat, no diff → Skip ✅
2. Clean merge, has chat, no diff → Generate (strategic discussion)
3. Merge with conflicts, no chat, has diff → Generate ✅ (v2 fix)
4. Merge with conflicts, has chat, has diff → Generate

**Phase 4 Updates**:
- Added diff check task
- Updated test scenarios to cover 4 cases
- Updated implementation locations to include diff collection
- Updated skip reason telemetry: `merge_no_changes_no_chat`

**Status**: Design refinement complete, ready for Phase 4 implementation

### 2025-10-18: Phase 4 Design Discussion - Hybrid Merge Commit Approach
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Commits**: None (design phase)
**Focus**: Refining merge commit handling strategy based on edge case analysis

**Design Decisions Made**:
- [x] DD-016: Hybrid merge commit handling - skip only silent merges
- [x] Updated Phase 4 with research task for substantial chat filter
- [x] Updated Phase 5 validation to test both silent and chatty merges
- [x] Reordered phases (4 before 5) per user request

**Key Discussion Points**:
1. **Problem identified**: Initial approach to skip ALL merge commits would lose valuable context:
   - Merge conflicts involve real development decisions
   - Conflict resolution conversations with AI are valuable
   - Squash merges would lose all feature documentation
   - Integration insights and strategic merge decisions matter

2. **Solution: Chat activity as proxy**:
   - Skip merge commits ONLY if no chat messages during merge window
   - Generate journal if ANY chat activity (conservative approach)
   - Lower threshold than existing "substantial chat" filter
   - Higher stakes: skipping entire journal vs skipping dialogue section

3. **Research required**:
   - Investigate existing "substantial chat" filter implementation
   - Understand threshold for dialogue section (likely 5+ messages)
   - Decide whether to reuse logic or create simpler "any chat" check
   - Check metric: `commit_story.dialogue.substantial_user_messages`

4. **Edge cases analyzed**:
   - Silent conflict resolution → Skip (user chose not to document)
   - Pre-merge planning → Skip merge (feature commits have journals)
   - Post-merge fixes → Skip merge, generate for fix commit
   - Squash merges with chat → Generate (context preserved)
   - Octopus merges (3+ parents) → Generate if chat, skip if silent

**Phase 4 Updates**:
- Added research task as first step
- Clarified hybrid approach in goal and solution
- Listed specific test scenarios for validation
- Updated rationale to explain why hybrid is better

**Phase 5 Updates**:
- Added specific merge commit test scenarios
- Included telemetry validation for skip reasons
- Added test for dirty working tree verification

**Status**: Design complete, ready for implementation
**Next**: Implement Phase 4 per DD-016 strategy

### 2025-10-18: Phase 2 Implementation Complete
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Commits**: b86937d, e5edb4d, 1cb9027, 260b86a, bcc8d90, 207bdaa
**Implementation**: Hook-level prevention to eliminate recursive journal generation

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Commit analysis utility - Created `src/utils/commit-analyzer.js` with `getChangedFilesInCommit()` and `isJournalEntriesOnlyCommit()` functions
- [x] Early exit check - Modified `src/index.js` (lines 205-213) to skip journal-entries-only commits before context collection
- [x] Comprehensive testing - All 6 test scenarios passed:
  - ✅ Historical journal-only commit (1104c468): Skipped
  - ✅ New journal-only commit (e5edb4d): Skipped
  - ✅ Mixed commits (code + journal): Ran normally
  - ✅ Code-only commits: Ran normally
  - ✅ Reflection-only commits: Ran normally (manual content)
  - ✅ Context-only commits: Ran normally (manual content)

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Detection logic**: Uses `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r` to get changed files
- **Pattern matching**: Simple `file.startsWith('journal/entries/')` check for clarity
- **Placement**: Early exit after CLI parsing, before expensive `gatherContextForCommit()`
- **Error handling**: Defaults to allowing execution on git command failures (safer)
- **Observability**: Debug logs show "⏭️  Skipping commit (only journal entries changed: N files)"

**Key Design Decision**:
Implemented at application entry point (`src/index.js`) rather than in bash hook (`hooks/post-commit`) because:
- Access to proper error handling and span management
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Can leverage debug logging infrastructure
- Cleaner separation of concerns (hook stays simple, logic in JS)

**Problem Solved**: Recursive journal generation (Problem 1 from PRD)
- Journal-only commits no longer trigger hook execution
- Eliminates "journal entry about adding a journal entry" noise
- Preserves execution for manual content (reflections, context captures)

**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Diff-Level Filtering to solve context pollution (Problem 2)

### 2025-10-18: Phase 3 Implementation Complete
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Commits**: c41de1c, b6e7ad1, f08eb69, (cleanup pending)
**Branch**: feature/prd-32-phase-3-diff-filtering
**Implementation**: Diff-level filtering to eliminate context pollution from mixed commits

**Completed PRD Items**:
- [x] Git pathspec filtering - Added `:!journal/entries/` to `git diff-tree` command in `src/collectors/git-collector.js` (line 57)
- [x] File list filtering - Updated `src/generators/utils/commit-content-analyzer.js` (lines 33-42) to filter journal entries from `changedFiles` array
- [x] Comprehensive testing - All 3 test scenarios passed:
  - ✅ Mixed commits: Journal entries filtered from diffs (commit b6e7ad1)
  - ✅ Reflections preserved: NOT filtered, manual content visible (commit f08eb69)
  - ✅ Context bleed eliminated: Commit 441db893 regenerates cleanly, no AGPL license pollution

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Git-level filtering**: Added pathspec `:!journal/entries/` to git diff-tree command for efficiency
- **Double filtering**: Both git-collector (at collection) and commit-content-analyzer (at processing) filter journal entries
- **Pattern matching**: Simple `!file.startsWith('journal/entries/')` check for clarity and maintainability
- **Preservation**: Reflections (`journal/reflections/**`) and context captures (`journal/context/**`) explicitly not filtered

**Test Results**:
1. **Mixed commit test** (b6e7ad1): Changed 2 files (journal entry + code)
   - Journal entry NOT visible in diff ✅
   - Only code file (`src/utils/commit-analyzer.js`) visible in generated journal

2. **Reflection preservation test** (f08eb69): Added reflection file
   - Reflection file visible in journal entry ✅
   - Manual content preserved as designed

3. **Context bleed fix validation** (441db893 dry-run):
   - Original issue: Summary incorrectly mentioned AGPL license from previous commit
   - After fix: Summary only discusses gitignore changes ✅
   - No context pollution from old journal entries

**Problem Solved**: Context pollution (Problem 2 from PRD)
- Journal entries no longer appear in git diffs for mixed commits
- Generators only see relevant code changes, not old journal content
- Eliminates "old solutions" references in new journal entries
- Manual content (reflections, context) preserved for user intent

**Key Design Decision**:
Implemented filtering at two levels (git collection + file analysis) for defense-in-depth:
- Git pathspec filters at source (most efficient)
- File list filter provides safety net and explicit documentation of intent
- Both use same pattern matching logic for consistency

**Next Phase**: Phase 4 validation largely complete during Phase 3 testing - only PRD documentation updates remain

### 2025-10-17: PRD Updated - Priority, Scope, and Research Strategy
- **Priority elevated to P0 (Critical)** - Must fix before next release
- **Added concrete example** of context bleed:
  - Commit 441db893 (gitignore) incorrectly mentions AGPL license from previous commit b0b0c9b2
  - Example location: journal/entries/2025-10/2025-10-17.md lines 48-83
- **Clarified filtering scope**:
  - ✅ Filter: `journal/entries/**` only (auto-generated)
  - ❌ DO NOT filter: `journal/reflections/**`, `journal/context/**` (manual user input)
- **Added telemetry-based research strategy**:
  - Start with Datadog trace analysis from 3 weeks ago vs now
  - Look for existing filtering logic that may have been bypassed
  - Investigate what changed in the data flow
- **Completed Phase 1** (Scope Definition) - filtering rules now clear
- **Updated all phases** to reflect journal-entries-only filtering scope
- **Answered open questions** about reflections, context, and chat vs diff filtering

### 2025-10-15: PRD Created
- Identified two distinct problems: recursive generation and context pollution
- Created GitHub issue #32
- Defined research phase to investigate root cause
- Added commit 1104c468 as test case
- Structured phases: Research → Scope Definition → Hook Prevention → Diff Filtering → Validation
