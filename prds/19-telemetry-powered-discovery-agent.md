# PRD-19: Telemetry-Powered Discovery Agent

**GitHub Issue**: [#19](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/19)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Datadog MCP server, commit-story telemetry infrastructure

## Executive Summary

Create an intelligent Claude Code agent that uses runtime telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces) to provide developers with accurate system architecture understanding, preventing architectural blindness that occurs with static code analysis alone.

## Context & Motivation

### Current State
Developers rely on static code analysis for system understanding:
- Reading imports/exports to understand dependencies
- Grepping for function calls and references
- Making assumptions about runtime behavior based on code structure
- Building mental models from incomplete information

### The Problem
Static analysis creates "architectural blindness":
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Dynamic imports, conditional flows, event-driven patterns
- **Runtime Behavior**: Actual data flows vs intended code paths
- **Usage Patterns**: Which services/functions are actually called in practice
- **Impact Assessment**: Unknown downstream effects of changes

### Real Examples
- Code shows service A imports service B, but telemetry shows A actually calls services C, D, E at runtime
- Function appears unused in static analysis, but traces show it's critical for error handling
- Microservice dependencies look simple in code, but runtime reveals complex interaction patterns

### The Opportunity
Leverage existing telemetry infrastructure to provide **runtime-informed system discovery** that complements static analysis with actual operational behavior.

## Success Criteria

1. **Accurate Discovery**: Agent provides precise answers about runtime dependencies and data flows
2. **Complementary Insights**: Reveals system behavior invisible to static analysis
3. **Actionable Intelligence**: Findings directly support development and architectural decisions
4. **Flexible Usage**: Works both ad-hoc ("What calls this?") and in workflows (PRD planning)
5. **Performance**: Query responses in <10 seconds for typical discovery requests

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Service Dependency Mapping
**Purpose**: Understand actual service-to-service communication patterns

**Capabilities**:
- Query traces to find services that actually call each other
- Identify communication protocols and patterns (HTTP, gRPC, events)
- Detect conditional dependencies (only called under certain conditions)
- Show frequency and volume of interactions

#### 2. Function/Component Flow Analysis
**Purpose**: Trace how data flows through system components

**Capabilities**:
- Follow request paths through multiple services/functions
- Identify data transformations and processing steps
- Show error handling and retry patterns
- Reveal parallel vs sequential processing flows

#### 3. Usage Pattern Discovery
**Purpose**: Understand which code paths are actually exercised

**Capabilities**:
- Identify hot paths and critical functions from span frequency
- Find unused or rarely-called components
- Detect seasonal or time-based usage patterns
- Show load distribution across system components

#### 4. Impact Analysis Support
**Purpose**: Predict effects of changes based on runtime relationships

**Capabilities**:
- Map all services/functions downstream from a given component
- Identify potential blast radius for changes
- Find related functionality through shared data flows
- Detect components that might be affected by dependency changes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Fast Queries**: Response time <10 seconds for most discovery requests
- **Accurate Data**: Use recent telemetry (last 24-48 hours) for current system state
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Separate signal from noise in high-volume telemetry
- **Clear Presentation**: Visual or structured output that's easy to understand
- **Graceful Degradation**: Useful results even with partial telemetry data

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Discovery Engine
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Basic service dependency discovery from trace data
- [ ] Simple "what calls what" queries using Datadog MCP
- [ ] Data filtering and aggregation logic
- [ ] Initial agent framework integration

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent can answer "What services does X call?" with actual runtime data
- Response includes frequency and recent examples
- Results are filtered to remove noise and test traffic

### Phase 2: Flow Analysis & Visualization
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Request flow tracing across multiple services
- [ ] Data transformation and processing step identification
- [ ] Error path and retry pattern detection
- [ ] Visual or structured flow representation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent can trace complete request paths from entry to exit
- Shows branching, parallel processing, and error handling
- Identifies performance bottlenecks and failure points

### Phase 3: Usage Patterns & Impact Analysis
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: Medium

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Hot path and critical component identification
- [ ] Unused or rarely-called function detection
- [ ] Downstream dependency mapping for impact analysis
- [ ] Load distribution and capacity insights

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent identifies most/least used system components
- Can predict blast radius of changes to specific components
- Provides load and capacity insights for architectural decisions

### Phase 4: Workflow Integration
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Priority**: Medium

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Integration with `/prd-next` and `/prd-update-progress` workflows
- [ ] Automated discovery triggers for relevant PRD activities
- [ ] Contextual insights based on PRD focus areas
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Discovery insights automatically enhance PRD planning workflows
- Agent provides relevant system context without overwhelming users
- Integrations are optional and can be disabled if needed

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Interface
```
/discover-system [component|service|function] [options]
```

**Examples**:
- `/discover-system auth-service` - Show all dependencies and interactions
- `/discover-system generate-summary --flows` - Trace data flows for this function
- `/discover-system user-service --impact` - Show downstream dependencies

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Datadog traces via MCP server
- **Secondary**: Datadog metrics for volume/frequency data
- **Tertiary**: Datadog logs for error patterns and edge cases

### Intelligence Layer
- Query optimization to handle large trace datasets
- Pattern recognition for common architectural patterns
- Noise filtering to focus on meaningful relationships
- Caching to improve response times for repeated queries

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Telemetry data too noisy | High | Medium | Develop sophisticated filtering algorithms |
| Query performance issues | Medium | High | Implement caching and query optimization |
| Agent provides misleading insights | Medium | High | Validate findings against multiple data sources |
| Integration complexity | Low | Medium | Build modular, optional integration points |

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Query response time (target: <10 seconds)
- Discovery accuracy rate (manual validation sample)
- Usage frequency (queries per day/week)
- User satisfaction scores

### Qualitative
- Developers report better system understanding
- Fewer "surprises" during code changes
- More confident architectural decisions
- Reduced time spent on system discovery

## Work Log

### 2025-09-21: PRD Creation
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Activities**:
- Created GitHub issue #19
- Drafted comprehensive PRD based on telemetry infrastructure success
- Aligned with agent-based architecture approach
- Defined phases and success criteria

**Key Insights**:
- Discovery agent has highest immediate value and lowest complexity
- Should be built first to establish patterns for debugging and validation agents
- Integration points should be flexible to support both ad-hoc and workflow usage

**Next Steps**:
- Review and refine technical requirements
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Design agent interface and query patterns

## Open Questions

1. **Query Scope**: How far back in telemetry history should discovery queries look?
2. **Visualization**: Should the agent generate visual diagrams or focus on structured text?
3. **Caching Strategy**: How to balance fresh data with performance?
4. **Error Handling**: What to do when telemetry data is incomplete or missing?
5. **Integration Points**: Which existing Claude Code workflows would benefit most from discovery insights?
