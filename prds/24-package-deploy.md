# PRD-24: Package and Deploy Commit Story v1.1.0

## Metadata
- **Issue**: [#24](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/24)
- **Status**: Active
- **Created**: 2025-09-26
- **Author**: Whitney Lee
- **Dependencies**: PRD-23 (Debug Experience Improvements)

## Overview

### Problem Statement
The current published package (`commit-story@1.0.0`) lacks recent debug experience improvements and has not been validated for public usability. The package needs to be updated with enhanced debugging capabilities and deployed to external repositories to ensure it works reliably for public users.

### Solution
Create and publish `commit-story@1.1.0` with:
1. Debug experience improvements from PRD-23
2. Conditional OpenTelemetry telemetry (only active when `dev: true`)
3. Streamlined dependencies and user experience
4. Validation through deployment to external repository

### Key Benefits
- **Public-Ready Package**: Clean, lightweight package suitable for general use
- **Improved Debug Experience**: Clear feedback without internal telemetry noise
- **Validated Functionality**: Proven to work in external repositories
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Conditional telemetry that doesn't burden public users

## Dependencies

### PRD-23 Prerequisites
This PRD requires completion of PRD-23 (Debug Experience Improvements):
- ✅ Telemetry noise suppression
- ✅ Proper exit codes for error handling
- ✅ Actionable error messages with console.error
- ✅ Path normalization for robust chat data matching
- ✅ Clean debug output throughout codebase

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Installing Commit Story
**As a** developer wanting to add automated journaling to my repository
**I want** a simple installation process with minimal dependencies
**So that** I can quickly set up journal generation without complexity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `npm install commit-story` installs without unnecessary telemetry packages
- Installation completes in reasonable time with minimal output
- Setup process is clearly documented and straightforward

### Story 2: Developer Using Commit Story in Production
**As a** developer using Commit Story in my daily workflow
**I want** clean output without internal implementation details
**So that** my git workflow isn't cluttered with irrelevant messages

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Background mode produces no output on success
- Debug mode shows only relevant progress information
- No OpenTelemetry or dotenv messages visible to end users

### Story 3: Package Maintainer Monitoring Usage
**As a** package maintainer (Whitney)
**I want** telemetry available when developing and debugging
**So that** I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues without affecting users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Telemetry only activates with `dev: true` configuration
- All OpenTelemetry functionality preserved for development use
- No impact on package size or user experience

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Package Configuration
- **R1.1**: Update package.json to version 1.1.0
- **R1.2**: Keep OpenTelemetry packages in regular `dependencies`
- **R1.3**: Maintain core functionality with minimal dependencies (dotenv, openai)
- **R1.4**: Ensure all CLI binaries work correctly in installed package

#### 2. Conditional Telemetry
- **R2.1**: OpenTelemetry only initializes when `dev: true` in config
- **R2.2**: Graceful degradation when telemetry is disabled
- **R2.3**: No user-visible telemetry messages unless in dev mode
- **R2.4**: All narrative logging remains conditional on dev mode

#### 3. Installation Experience
- **R3.1**: Clean npm install output without warnings
- **R3.2**: Hook installation script works correctly from installed package
- **R3.3**: Configuration file creation functions properly
- **R3.4**: All file paths resolve correctly when installed in node_modules

#### 4. External Repository Validation
- **R4.1**: Successfully install in external repository
- **R4.2**: Generate journal entries without errors
- **R4.3**: Debug experience matches expectations from PRD-23
- **R4.4**: No path-related issues with chat data collection

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Performance
- **N1.1**: Package install time under 30 seconds on standard connection
- **N1.2**: No performance degradation from conditional telemetry
- **N1.3**: Memory usage remains reasonable without telemetry overhead

#### 2. Reliability
- **N2.1**: Works consistently across different operating systems
- **N2.2**: Handles various repository structures and paths
- **N2.3**: Graceful failure with clear error messages

#### 3. Maintainability
- **N3.1**: Clear separation between dev and production features
- **N3.2**: Easy to test both with and without telemetry
- **N3.3**: Version management follows semantic versioning

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Version Strategy
**Choice**: Release as version 1.1.0 (minor version bump)
**Rationale**: New features and improvements but no breaking changes
**Tradeoffs**: Signals enhancement rather than fundamental change

### Decision 2: OpenTelemetry Dependency Management
**Choice**: Keep OTel in regular dependencies, make initialization conditional
**Rationale**: Simpler than conditional imports, reliable runtime behavior
**Tradeoffs**: Slightly larger package size but much more maintainable

### Decision 3: Telemetry Control
**Choice**: Use existing `dev: true` config flag to control OTel
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing pattern, no new configuration needed
**Tradeoffs**: Less granular than separate telemetry flag but simpler

### Decision 4: Validation Strategy
**Choice**: Deploy to real external repository for validation
**Rationale**: Most authentic test of public user experience
**Tradeoffs**: More manual testing but higher confidence in results

## Implementation Plan

### Milestone 1: Conditional Telemetry Implementation (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Make OpenTelemetry conditional on `dev: true` configuration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Modify tracing.js to check dev mode before initialization
- [ ] Add conditional imports/initialization for all OTel components
- [ ] Test telemetry works when dev: true
- [ ] Test graceful operation when dev: false
- [ ] Verify no telemetry messages appear for public users

**Dependencies**: PRD-23 completion
**Documentation Updates**: None required (internal change)

### Milestone 2: Package Preparation (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Prepare package for v1.1.0 release

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update version number in package.json
- [ ] Verify all files are included in npm package (check .npmignore)
- [ ] Test CLI binaries work from installed package
- [ ] Update any hardcoded version references
- [ ] Prepare release notes documenting improvements

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update README with new version features
- Add troubleshooting section reflecting PRD-23 improvements

### Milestone 3: Local Testing and Validation (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Validate package works correctly before publishing

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create local package with `npm pack`
- [ ] Install local package in test directory
- [ ] Verify hook installation works
- [ ] Test journal generation with debug modes
- [ ] Validate no telemetry noise in public mode

**Documentation Updates**:
- Test installation instructions in README

### Milestone 4: Publishing and External Validation (Priority: Medium)
**Goal**: Publish package and validate in external repository

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Publish v1.1.0 to npm registry
- [ ] Install in external repository (Whitney's other repo)
- [ ] Complete full user workflow (install, init, commit, journal generation)
- [ ] Document any issues found and resolve them
- [ ] Verify all success criteria met

**Documentation Updates**:
- Update README with validated usage examples
- Add any lessons learned from external deployment

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Package install completes in under 30 seconds
- Zero OpenTelemetry messages visible to public users
- Journal generation success rate of 100% in external repository
- Package size increase less than 50% from conditional telemetry

### Qualitative
- Installation process feels smooth and professional
- Debug output is clear and helpful without being overwhelming
- External repository testing validates public usability
- Maintainer can still access full telemetry when needed

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Conditional Telemetry Breaks Existing Functionality
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Thorough testing with both dev modes, gradual rollout

### Risk 2: Package Installation Issues in Different Environments
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Test on multiple operating systems, clear error messages

### Risk 3: Path Resolution Issues When Installed
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Test thoroughly with npm-installed package, not just local development

### Risk 4: External Repository Has Different Claude Code Setup
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Test with repository similar to typical user environment

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
1. **Local Package Testing**: Use `npm pack` and install locally
2. **Mode Testing**: Verify both `dev: true` and `dev: false` scenarios
3. **CLI Testing**: Ensure all binaries work from installed package
4. **Hook Testing**: Validate git hook installation and execution

### Production Testing
1. **External Repository**: Install in Whitney's other repository
2. **User Workflow**: Complete full user experience from install to journal
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test with missing config, API keys, etc.
4. **Performance**: Measure install time and runtime performance

### Regression Testing
1. **Existing Features**: Ensure all current functionality preserved
2. **Telemetry**: Verify dev mode still provides full instrumentation
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Test with existing configuration files
