# PRD-20: Telemetry-Powered Debugging Agent

**GitHub Issue**: [#20](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/20)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Dependencies**: Datadog MCP server, commit-story telemetry infrastructure

## Executive Summary

Create an intelligent Claude Code agent that uses correlated logs, metrics, and traces to help developers diagnose problems by automatically gathering runtime context, identifying error patterns, and suggesting root causes based on actual system behavior.

## Context & Motivation

### Current State
Debugging requires manual detective work across multiple tools:
- Searching logs for error messages and context
- Checking metrics dashboards for anomalies and trends
- Analyzing traces to understand request flow and timing
- Correlating information across different timeframes and systems

### The Problem
Manual debugging is slow and error-prone:
- **Context Switching**: Jumping between logs, metrics, traces, and code
- **Correlation Overhead**: Manual work to connect related telemetry signals
- **Pattern Blindness**: Missing recurring issues or similar failure modes
- **Investigation Fatigue**: Time-consuming searches that may miss key evidence

### Real Examples
- Error shows "Connection timeout" but root cause is upstream service overload (visible in metrics)
- Slow request traces reveal database query issues, but logs show why queries are slow
- Similar errors occurred last week with same root cause, but developer doesn't remember pattern

### The Opportunity
Leverage correlated telemetry to provide **intelligent debugging assistance** that automatically gathers context, recognizes patterns, and suggests investigation paths.

## Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Context**: Agent gathers all relevant telemetry for debugging in <30 seconds
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar historical issues and common failure modes
3. **Actionable Insights**: Provides specific investigation paths and probable root causes
4. **Time Savings**: Reduces time-to-diagnosis by 50% for common issue types
5. **Learning System**: Improves suggestions based on successful debugging patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Contextual Data Gathering
**Purpose**: Automatically collect all relevant debugging evidence

**Capabilities**:
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for specific timeframes and services
- Gather upstream and downstream telemetry for failed requests
- Collect system resource metrics during incident periods
- Find related errors and warnings in logs across services

#### 2. Error Pattern Recognition
**Purpose**: Identify known issues and failure patterns

**Capabilities**:
- Match current errors against historical incident patterns
- Identify cascading failure sequences across services
- Recognize performance degradation patterns in metrics
- Detect anomalous behavior compared to baseline trends

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis
**Purpose**: Suggest probable causes based on telemetry evidence

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze trace timing to identify bottlenecks and failures
- Correlate errors with resource constraints or external dependencies
- Match error signatures with known infrastructure or code issues
- Suggest investigation priorities based on evidence strength

#### 4. Temporal Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand system behavior before, during, and after incidents

**Capabilities**:
- Compare current behavior with historical baselines
- Identify what changed leading up to incidents
- Track incident resolution and recovery patterns
- Detect recurring issues with similar temporal characteristics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Fast Analysis**: Complete debugging context gathering in <30 seconds
- **Accurate Correlation**: Match related telemetry with >95% precision
- **Clear Presentation**: Prioritize findings by relevance and confidence
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide useful analysis even with partial data
- **Privacy Aware**: Handle sensitive data in logs appropriately

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Context Gathering

- [ ] Simple query interface for debugging scenarios

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent can gather all telemetry for "service X failed at time Y" scenarios
- Correlates upstream/downstream impacts for failed requests
- Presents organized debugging context within 30 seconds

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition & Analysis
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Historical error pattern matching against current issues
- [ ] Performance anomaly detection using metrics baselines
- [ ] Cascading failure sequence identification
- [ ] Similar incident correlation and grouping

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent identifies when current issues match historical patterns
- Detects performance anomalies relative to normal operation
- Groups related errors and identifies failure propagation paths

### Phase 3: Root Cause Suggestions
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Priority**: Medium

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Evidence-based root cause hypothesis generation
- [ ] Investigation priority ranking based on telemetry evidence
- [ ] Integration with code analysis for error-to-code mapping
- [ ] Confidence scoring for debugging suggestions

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent suggests specific root causes with supporting evidence
- Prioritizes investigation paths by likelihood and impact
- Provides code locations and system components to investigate

### Phase 4: Temporal Intelligence & Learning
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: Medium

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Before/after incident analysis with baseline comparisons
- [ ] Change detection and impact correlation
- [ ] Learning system that improves from successful debugging sessions
- [ ] Recurring issue detection and alerting

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Agent identifies what changed before incidents occurred
- Learns from debugging outcomes to improve future suggestions
- Detects recurring issues and suggests preventive actions

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Interface
```
/debug [service|error|performance] [timeframe] [options]
```

**Examples**:
- `/debug auth-service --last 1h` - Gather all debugging context for auth service
- `/debug "connection timeout" --around 2025-09-21T14:30` - Debug specific error at time
- `/debug performance user-service --compare yesterday` - Performance regression analysis

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Datadog logs, metrics, traces via MCP server
- **Secondary**: Application metrics and custom instrumentation
- **Tertiary**: Infrastructure metrics and system events

### Analysis Engine
- Pattern matching against historical telemetry data
- Anomaly detection using statistical baselines
- Correlation analysis across multiple data dimensions
- Machine learning for pattern recognition and root cause suggestion

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| False positive root cause suggestions | Medium | Medium | Confidence scoring and evidence presentation |
| Analysis too slow for urgent debugging | Medium | High | Performance optimization and caching strategies |
| Overwhelming users with too much data | High | Medium | Intelligent filtering and prioritization |
| Pattern recognition inaccuracy | Medium | High | Continuous learning and feedback loops |
| Privacy issues with sensitive log data | Low | High | Data sanitization and access controls |

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Context gathering time (target: <30 seconds)
- Root cause suggestion accuracy (validation through follow-up)
- Time-to-resolution improvement for debugged issues
- User satisfaction with debugging assistance

### Qualitative
