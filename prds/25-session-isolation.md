## Metadata
- **Issue**: [#25](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/25)
- **Status**: Active
- **Created**: 2025-09-26
- **Author**: Whitney Lee

## Overview

### Problem Statement
When multiple Claude Code tabs are open in the same repository working on different tasks, the chat collector mixes messages from ALL sessions into journal entries. This contaminates the narrative coherence of journal entries with unrelated conversations, breaking the intended story of each commit's development process.

### Evidence of the Problem
Recent journal entry for the PRD-24 commit contained this question from a parallel session:
```
**Human:** "Question. Does prd-9 have a plan for evaluating updated code, not just net-new code? We have some of each from yesterday's prd-17 updates"
```

This PRD-9 question came from a different Claude Code tab working on unrelated functionality but was mixed into the PRD-24 journal entry about packaging and deployment.

### Solution
Implement session isolation using the `sessionId` field available in Claude Code message data to ensure journal entries only contain messages from the relevant conversation thread.

### Key Benefits
- **Narrative Coherence**: Journal entries tell a focused story of each commit's development
- **Accurate Documentation**: No contamination from parallel work streams
- **Improved Traceability**: Clear connection between conversation and resulting code changes
- **Better User Experience**: Journal entries make sense and provide value

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites**: None - This is a standalone bug fix
**Blocks**: Clean demo experience without chat contamination
**Related PRDs**: Part of conference roadmap (PRD-26)

## Research Foundation

Based on research in [`docs/dev/claude-chat-research.md`](../docs/dev/claude-chat-research.md) which provides comprehensive analysis of Claude Code message structure and filtering patterns:

### Claude Code Message Structure
- **Storage**: `~/.claude/projects/[project-path-encoded]/*.jsonl`
- **Format**: JSONL with one JSON object per line
- **Key Fields**:
  - `sessionId`: Unique identifier for each Claude Code instance/conversation
  - `cwd`: Current working directory (repository path)
  - `timestamp`: UTC ISO format
  - `uuid`: Unique message identifier
  - `parentUuid`: Links to previous message

### Current Filtering Mechanism
The chat collector currently filters by:
1. **Repository path**: `message.cwd === repoPath`
2. **Time window**: Messages between previous commit and current commit

**Missing**: No filtering by `sessionId`, allowing messages from all sessions to mix

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Working on Multiple Features
**As a** developer working on multiple features in parallel using different Claude Code tabs
**I want** journal entries to only include conversations related to each specific commit
**So that** each journal tells a coherent story without unrelated discussions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Journal entries contain messages only from the session that created the commit
- No contamination from parallel Claude Code sessions in the same repository
- Automatic session detection without manual configuration

### Story 2: Developer Reviewing Journal History
**As a** developer reviewing past journal entries to understand development decisions
**I want** clean, focused narratives for each commit
**So that** I can quickly understand the context and reasoning behind each change

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Historical context is preserved and accurate
- Each journal entry has narrative coherence
- Technical decisions are clearly connected to their discussions

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Session Detection (Revised per DD-010)
- **R1.1**: Group collected messages by sessionId field
- **R1.2**: If single sessionId present, use all messages (Plan A - fast path)
- **R1.3**: If multiple sessionIds present, apply AI session relevance filter (Plan B)
- **R1.4**: AI filter determines which sessions relate to commit changes based on semantic analysis

#### 2. Message Filtering
- **R2.1**: Filter messages to include only the detected session's messages
- **R2.2**: Preserve all existing filtering (repository path, time window)
- **R2.3**: Maintain message chronological order within session
- **R2.4**: Graceful fallback if session detection fails

#### 3. Debug Visibility
- **R3.1**: Show which session was selected in debug mode
- **R3.2**: Display session detection reasoning and confidence
- **R3.3**: Log session statistics (count, message ranges, selection criteria)
- **R3.4**: Enable troubleshooting of session selection issues

#### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **R4.1**: No breaking changes for users with single Claude Code sessions
- **R4.2**: Existing journal entries remain unchanged
- **R4.3**: Configuration file format unchanged
- **R4.4**: Performance impact minimal for single-session usage

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Accuracy
- **N1.1**: Correct session selection in 95%+ of cases
- **N1.2**: False positive rate (wrong session) under 5%
- **N1.3**: False negative rate (no session selected) under 2%

#### 2. Performance
- **N2.1**: Session detection adds less than 500ms to journal generation
- **N2.2**: Memory usage increase less than 20% for multiple sessions
- **N2.3**: No impact on repositories with single sessions

#### 3. Maintainability
- **N3.1**: Session detection logic is well-documented and testable
- **N3.2**: Clear separation of concerns in collector code
- **N3.3**: Debuggable with clear logging and metrics

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Validation-Based Selection Over Time Heuristics
**Choice**: Use definitive signals (git commit presence) and AI content analysis instead of time-based guessing
**Rationale**: Telemetry analysis revealed that "most recent activity" heuristics would fail for terminal commits and parallel workflows
**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 2: Plan A → Plan C Approach (Skip Unreliable Heuristics)
**Choice**:
- **Plan A**: Check if session's last messages contain git commit command/output
- **Plan C**: Use AI to analyze session content against git diff for relevance
- **Skip Plan B**: Avoid unreliable signals like "git add" or "git stage" commands
**Rationale**: Keep it simple - use definitive signals first, then intelligent analysis. No guessing.
**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 3: Filter Each Session Independently
**Choice**: Apply noise filtering (tool calls, system messages) to each session separately before selection
**Rationale**: Telemetry logs revealed filtering happens in collector ("40 noisy messages" removed) - this should happen per-session for clean AI comparison
**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 4: Debug Output Format
**Choice**: Structured debug output showing session selection reasoning
**Example**:
```
[DEBUG] Session Detection:
  - Found 2 active sessions in time window
  - Session abc123: 15 messages, last activity 2min ago
  - Session def456: 3 messages, last activity 30min ago
  - Selected: abc123 (most recent activity)
```

### Decision 5: Implementation Location Before Noise Filtering
**Choice**: Session detection logic must be implemented in `claude-collector.js` BEFORE noise filtering occurs
**Rationale**: Git commit evidence exists in tool_use messages (Bash commands) and tool_result messages (git output), which are filtered out as "noise" in context-filter.js. To detect which session contains git commit commands, we must examine raw messages before filtering.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 6: Git Commit Detection via Bash Tool Use
**Choice**: For multi-tab scenarios, detect git commit by looking for assistant messages with Bash tool_use containing "git commit" in the input.command field
**Rationale**: User workflow involves `/prd-update-progress` which executes git commands via Claude's Bash tool. This creates definitive evidence in the form of tool_use messages with "git commit" commands.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 7: Single Session Fast Path
**Choice**: If only one sessionId exists in all collected messages, use it immediately without detection logic
**Rationale**: Single session is the common case and should be optimized. No need for detection overhead when there's no ambiguity.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 8: Scope Limitation - Focus on Realistic Problems
**Choice**: Address multi-tab contamination first, defer complex edge cases (sequential sessions, compaction behavior) for future research
**Rationale**: The primary issue is simultaneous multi-tab work creating contamination. Sequential session scenarios are less common and add significant complexity.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 9: Fallback Documentation Strategy
**Choice**: If session detection proves too complex, document that the system works best with single Claude Code sessions
**Rationale**: Provides user expectation management and clear boundaries for supported workflows
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided (as backup plan)

### Decision 10: Architectural Pivot - Simplify to Plan A/B Approach
**Choice**: Replace complex git commit detection with simple two-path logic:
- **Plan A**: Single sessionId detected → use all messages (fast path)
- **Plan B**: Multiple sessionIds detected → AI-powered session relevance filter
**Rationale**: Previous approach (DD-001 through DD-006) was overengineered. Clean separation between simple case (no overhead) and complex case (AI intelligence) is more maintainable and handles all scenarios.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 11: AI Session Filter for Multi-Session Cases
**Choice**: When multiple sessions detected, use dedicated AI call to determine which sessions relate to the commit changes
**Rationale**: AI excels at semantic understanding of "does this conversation relate to these code changes?" Handles all edge cases (sequential work, terminal commits, mixed content) naturally without reverse-engineering Claude Code internals.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 12: Research Phase Remains Critical for AI Context
**Choice**: Keep Phase 1 research requirements despite architectural simplification
**Rationale**: AI filter needs to understand WHY multiple sessions exist (parallel tabs vs sequential work vs compaction) to provide appropriate prompting context. Without sessionId lifecycle understanding, AI can't make informed decisions.
**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: ✅ Decided

### Decision 13: AI Reasoning Emission During Session Filtering
**Choice**: Modify AI session filter to emit explicit reasoning process during evaluation
**Rationale**: Current AI filter makes decisions without exposing its reasoning, making it difficult to debug session selection issues or validate correctness. Emitted reasoning should be captured in telemetry for troubleshooting and system improvement.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ❌ Outstanding
**Implementation**: Add reasoning field to AI response format, log reasoning to narrative telemetry

### Decision 14: /clear Command Session Boundary Detection Strategy
**Choice**: Detect session boundaries across /clear commands by identifying:
- **Pre-clear session**: Session containing `/clear` as final user message
- **Post-clear session**: New sessionId starting immediately after with `parentUuid: null`
**Rationale**: `/clear` creates definitive session breaks that should be handled intelligently - either as related continuation (same feature work) or separate contexts (topic change). Detection can be programmatic (message pattern matching) rather than relying solely on AI to understand the pattern.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ❌ Outstanding
**Implementation**: Add /clear boundary detection in session grouping logic

### Decision 15: Validation Testing with Known /clear Commit
**Choice**: Use the specific commit containing documented /clear command usage as primary validation test case
**Rationale**: Real-world /clear usage provides authentic test scenario for session boundary detection. This commit occurred after code writing but before /add-telemetry command execution, creating perfect multi-session contamination test case.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ✅ Identified - **Commit `a7af51e`**
**Implementation**: Test against commit `a7af51e` which represents implementation work done after `/clear` command, creating pre-clear and post-clear session boundary for validation

### Decision 16: Enhanced Telemetry for /clear-Aware Testing
**Choice**: Conditionally rerun /add-telemetry command with enhanced instructions if testing reveals gaps in /clear scenario handling
**Rationale**: Current telemetry instrumentation may need updates to properly capture /clear boundary detection and reasoning emission. Only rerun if validation testing identifies missing telemetry coverage.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ❌ Outstanding
**Implementation**: Assess telemetry gaps after /clear testing, enhance instrumentation if needed

### Decision 17: /clear Detection Strategy Correction Based on Real Data
**Choice**: Detect `/clear` command by looking for NEW sessions that contain XML metadata `<command-name>/clear</command-name>` in early messages, not by looking for sessions that end with `/clear` text
**Rationale**: Investigation of actual JSONL data revealed that Claude Code creates a brand new session immediately when user runs `/clear`, and includes structured XML metadata about the command in the new session. The old session simply ends normally with no `/clear` marker.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ✅ Documented
**Implementation**:
- Detection pattern: `msg.content?.includes('<command-name>/clear</command-name>')` in first 3 messages of session
- Session linking: Use timestamp correlation to connect sessions that end normally with sessions that start with `/clear` metadata
- Update Plan A.5 logic to use correct detection strategy

### Decision 18: Strategic Abandonment - Single Session Approach
**Choice**: Abandon multi-session support entirely. Document that commit-story is designed for single Claude Code session workflows only.
**Rationale**: Multiple fatal flaws discovered during implementation planning:
1. **Time Window Problem**: Sequential commits truncate conversation history. User working on payments/auth/shipping in parallel tabs, commits payments at 2:00 PM, then shipping at 2:01 PM - shipping commit journal only captures 1 minute of context, losing hours of design discussion.
2. **Complexity Explosion**: Session correlation, timestamp linking, /clear boundary detection, AI reasoning emission, overlapping vs sequential logic - each solution creates new edge cases.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ❌ Outstanding - Requires implementation revert and README update
**Implementation**:
- Revert all session isolation code changes via git
- Add README guidance: "System designed for single Claude Code session per project"
- Document multi-session limitations clearly

### Decision 19: Comprehensive Implementation Revert Plan
**Choice**: Use git-based revert strategy rather than manual code deletion to remove session isolation implementation
**Rationale**: Preserves implementation history while cleanly returning to pre-session-isolation state. Safer than manual deletion, maintains git history for future reference.
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ❌ Outstanding - Requires git revert execution
**Implementation**:
- Identify commit range for session isolation implementation
- Create revert commits for: session-filter.js creation, claude-collector.js modifications, telemetry standards updates
- Test that revert restores original functionality
- Verify no session isolation logic remains in codebase

## ~~Technical Specification~~ (ABANDONED)

**Status**: ❌ **ABANDONED** - See DD-018, DD-019

The technical specification for session isolation has been abandoned due to fundamental architectural issues. The complex session selection algorithms, AI content analysis, and git commit detection logic proved to be solving the wrong problem.

**Key Insight**: Instead of building complex systems to guess which conversations relate to which commits, the system is now designed for single-session workflows where this ambiguity doesn't exist.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Session Selection Accuracy**: >95% correct selection in test scenarios
- **Performance Impact**: <500ms additional processing time
- **Memory Usage**: <20% increase for multi-session scenarios
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% incorrect session selection

### Qualitative
- **Journal Coherence**: Entries tell focused, coherent stories
- **User Satisfaction**: No complaints about mixed conversations
- **Debug Experience**: Clear visibility into session selection
- **Development Workflow**: No interruption to existing practices

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Incorrect Session Detection
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (contaminated journal entries)
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive testing with various scenarios
- Conservative confidence thresholds
- Fallback to current behavior when uncertain
- Debug output for troubleshooting

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Benchmarking before/after implementation
- Early exit optimizations for single sessions
- Efficient grouping algorithms

### Risk 3: Breaking Changes
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive testing with existing repositories
- Fallback mechanisms preserve current behavior
- Gradual rollout approach

### Risk 4: Complex Edge Cases
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Document known limitations
- Provide debug tools for investigation
- Community feedback for edge case discovery

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Session grouping logic
- Activity scoring algorithm
- Edge case handling (equal scores, no activity, etc.)
- Confidence calculation accuracy

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end journal generation with multiple sessions
- Fallback behavior when detection fails
- Debug output format and content
- Performance benchmarks

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Two tabs, different features**: Parallel work on unrelated functionality
2. **Two tabs, same feature**: Collaborative work on single feature
3. **Sequential sessions**: One tab closed, another opened
4. **Inactive sessions**: One tab active, one idle
5. **Overlapping activity**: Both tabs active near commit time
6. **/clear command boundary testing**: Use commit `a7af51e` to test pre-clear and post-clear session detection across `/clear` command usage

### Contaminated Commit Test Cases
**Purpose**: Use real contamination examples to validate session isolation effectiveness

**Primary Test Case - PRD-24/PRD-9 Contamination**:
- **Location**: `journal/entries/2025-09/2025-09-26.md`
- **Issue**: PRD-24 commit journal contains unrelated PRD-9 question from parallel session
- **Evidence**: "Question. Does prd-9 have a plan for evaluating updated code, not just net-new code?"
- **Expected Result**: After session isolation, PRD-24 journal should contain only PRD-24 related conversation

**Secondary Test Cases - Multi-Commit Scenarios**:
- **Location**: `journal/entries/2025-09/2025-09-25.md`
- **Issue**: Multiple commits with potentially overlapping session activity
- **Purpose**: Test both Plan A (git commit detection) and Plan C (AI analysis) scenarios
- **Expected Result**: Each commit journal contains only its relevant session conversations

**Validation Method**:
1. Regenerate journals for contaminated commits using new session isolation logic
2. Compare before/after results to measure contamination reduction
3. Verify narrative coherence improved in each journal entry
4. Confirm no legitimate conversation context was lost

## Outstanding Research Questions

### Phase 1: Human/AI Collaborative Research (Required before implementation)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High

**Questions requiring empirical research**:
1. **Sequential Session Behavior**: What happens when user closes Claude and reopens to continue same feature work?
   - Does new tab get new sessionId?
   - How common is this workflow?
   - Should sequential sessions be linked?

2. **Compaction Impact**: When Claude compacts long conversations, does sessionId change?
   - Can we observe this in real JSONL data?
   - How would this affect detection?

3. **Claude Code Restart Behavior**: When Claude Code application is quit and restarted, are sessionIds preserved?
   - Test with actual quit/restart cycle
   - Check JSONL files for evidence

4. **Real Usage Patterns**: User's actual multi-tab workflow frequency
   - How many tabs typically open?
   - Do tabs stay open for days?
   - Terminal commit frequency?

**Research Methodology**:
- Review existing JSONL files for session patterns
- Conduct controlled testing of Claude Code behavior
- Document findings before proceeding with complex implementation

### The Context Problem: Why Research Remains Critical

Despite the architectural simplification to Plan A/B, understanding sessionId lifecycle is essential for the AI filter to work correctly.

**The AI filter needs different instructions based on why multiple sessions exist:**

**Scenario 1 - Parallel Tabs (Different Features)**:
- User has 2+ tabs working on unrelated features simultaneously
- AI instruction: \"Pick the session most relevant to this commit's changes\"
- Expected: Select one session, ignore others

**Scenario 2 - Sequential Work (Same Feature)**:
- User closed Claude, reopened, continued same feature work
- AI instruction: \"These may be continuation of same work, include all relevant sessions\"
- Expected: Select multiple sessions that form logical sequence

**Scenario 3 - Compaction/System Behavior**:
- Long conversation triggered sessionId change due to Claude's internal behavior
- AI instruction: \"These sessions may be the same logical conversation\"
- Expected: Treat as single session despite different sessionIds

**Without research understanding, the AI filter gets ambiguous instructions and may:**
- Exclude important sequential context (Scenario 2)
- Include irrelevant parallel work (Scenario 1)
- Miss system-generated session splits (Scenario 3)

This is why Phase 1 research cannot be skipped even with the simplified approach."

**Problem**: Implementation needed to detect when user runs `/clear` command to reset conversation, but the actual message structure was unknown.

**Investigation Method**: Searched through real JSONL files to find session `50ae381d` which was created after a `/clear` command.

**Key Discovery**: The `/clear` command does NOT appear as a simple text message. Instead:

1. **When user runs `/clear`**: Claude Code creates a brand new session immediately
2. **New session contains**: XML-structured metadata about the `/clear` command
3. **Actual message structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "user",
  "message": {
    "content": "<command-name>/clear</command-name>\n            <command-message>clear</command-message>\n            <command-args></command-args>"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-29T14:21:41.129Z"
}
```
4. **Session boundary marker**: New session starts with `parentUuid: null`

**Impact on Implementation**:
- Detection must look for sessions that START WITH `/clear` metadata (not sessions that end with `/clear`)
- Pattern to detect: `msg.content?.includes('<command-name>/clear</command-name>')` in session's first few messages
- Session linking: Find sessions that begin immediately after other sessions end (timestamp correlation)

**Decision Added**: DD-017 - /clear Detection Strategy uses XML metadata pattern in new sessions

### 2025-09-30: Complete Implementation Revert and System Recovery ✅

### 2025-10-01: Session Grouping Enhancement Implementation ✅
**Duration**: ~4 hours implementation session
**Commits**: Ready for commit (session grouping implementation)
**Primary Focus**: Alternative approach - session grouping for AI comprehension instead of session isolation

**Enhancement Overview**:
While PRD-25's session isolation approach was strategically abandoned, a complementary enhancement was implemented: **session grouping for improved AI comprehension**. Instead of filtering out sessions (isolation), this approach organizes messages by sessionId while preserving all context for AI analysis.

**Completed Implementation Work**:
- **Session Message Grouping**: Modified `claude-collector.js` to group messages by sessionId after time/project filtering
- **Context Integration**: Updated `context-integrator.js` to handle session groups while maintaining backward compatibility with existing metadata calculation
- **AI Generator Updates**: Refactored all three generators (summary, dialogue, technical-decisions) to use session-grouped messages
- **DRY Utility Function**: Created `formatSessionsForAI()` utility in `src/utils/session-formatter.js` to standardize session formatting across generators
- **Telemetry Verification**: Confirmed session grouping works correctly with debug output showing proper session detection (e.g., 5 sessions for test commits)

**Technical Architecture**:
```
Raw Messages → Group by sessionId → Pass all sessions to AI → Better conversation thread understanding
```

**Key Difference from PRD-25**:
- **PRD-25 Approach**: Filter messages to prevent contamination (abandoned due to complexity)
- **Session Grouping**: Organize messages but let AI see all sessions for better context understanding
- **Benefit**: AI can better understand conversation flow without losing context from parallel work

**Files Modified**:
- `src/collectors/claude-collector.js` - Session grouping logic after existing filtering
- `src/integrators/context-integrator.js` - Handle session groups while preserving metadata
- `src/generators/summary-generator.js` - Use session groups via formatSessionsForAI()
- `src/generators/dialogue-generator.js` - Use session groups via formatSessionsForAI()
- `src/generators/technical-decisions-generator.js` - Use session groups via formatSessionsForAI()
- `src/utils/session-formatter.js` - New utility for consistent session formatting

**Testing Evidence**:
- **Multi-session Detection**: Confirmed 5 sessions detected for PRD-25 test commits
- **Session Boundary Detection**: Verified sessions properly grouped by sessionId including across `/clear` commands
- **AI Comprehension**: Session groups enable AI to better understand conversation threads and context flow

**Impact on Conference Readiness**:
- **No Breaking Changes**: Backward compatible with existing workflows
- **Enhanced AI Understanding**: Better journal narrative quality through improved conversation comprehension
- **Maintains Single-Session Design**: Works optimally with single Claude Code sessions while handling multi-session scenarios gracefully

**Next Session Priorities**:
- Continue with PRD-23 (Debug Experience) implementation
- Monitor session grouping effectiveness in real usage scenarios
- Consider formalizing session grouping approach in dedicated PRD if broader adoption warranted

### 2025-10-03: Critical Bug Fix - Session Grouping Filtering Bypass ✅
**Duration**: ~4 hours debugging and fix implementation session
**Commits**: Fix commit (filtering bypass resolution) + 12 journal regeneration commits
**Primary Focus**: Resolve filtering regression introduced by session grouping implementation

**Problem Discovered**:
- **Root Cause**: Session grouping implementation (commit 8db5ceb4) bypassed existing message filtering
- **Impact**: Generators received 448 unfiltered messages instead of 174 filtered messages
- **Symptom**: Dialogue generator timed out after 60 seconds due to excessive message volume
- **Evidence**: Datadog trace `8a9349bf` showed generators receiving `messages_count: 448` (unfiltered) while root span showed `messages_count: 174, total_messages: 448`

**Telemetry-Driven Debugging Process**:
1. **Trace Analysis**: Compared span attributes across root span and generator spans
2. **Data Flow Discovery**: Root span correctly filtered 448→174, but generators received 448
3. **Architecture Investigation**: Session grouping in `context-integrator.js` used `cleanChatSessions` (unfiltered) instead of filtered messages
4. **Root Cause Identified**: Line 440 set `chatSessions.data` to unfiltered session groups, bypassing `filteredContext.chatMessages`

**Fix Implementation**:
- **File Modified**: `src/integrators/context-integrator.js` (lines 399-414)
- **Solution**: Filter session groups to match `filteredContext.chatMessages` using timestamp/content matching
- **Architecture**: Apply filtering to session groups after flat message filtering, maintaining both filtered flat view and filtered session view

**Verification Evidence**:
- **Before Fix** (trace 8a9349bf):
  - Root span: `messages_count: 174`, `total_messages: 448`
  - Generators received: 448 messages (unfiltered)
  - Result: Dialogue timed out after 60 seconds

- **After Fix** (trace 9bc445d5):
  - Root span: `messages_count: 174`
  - Generators received: 174 messages (filtered)
  - Result: All generators completed successfully, no timeouts
  - **Token Reduction**: 61% reduction in messages passed to generators (448→174)

**Journal Regeneration**:
- **Scope**: Regenerated 12 commits from 8db5ceb4 onwards (all commits with broken filtering)
- **Oct 1**: 9 commits (8db5ceb4, e6720bf, b0a110d, 53dbcdb, + 5 pre-existing)
- **Oct 2**: 6 commits (3bb1003, cf36c06, 28e9184, 9906616, bbadf8d, 5cb22af)
- **Oct 3**: 2 commits (a36d380, 6dfa95e)
- **Verification**: All entries in correct chronological order, no timeouts, complete narratives

**Technical Achievements**:
- **Telemetry-Verified Fix**: Datadog traces confirm proper filtering in production
- **Data Integrity Restored**: All journal entries regenerated with correct filtered data
- **Performance Improvement**: 61% reduction in AI token usage for affected commits
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Fix maintains backward compatibility with session grouping enhancement

**Key Insight**: OpenTelemetry span correlation (`messages_count` attribute across root→generator spans) enabled rapid identification of the filtering bypass. Without telemetry, this would have required extensive manual debugging to discover the data flow issue.

**System Health**: ✅ Filtering working correctly, ✅ Generators completing successfully, ✅ Journal quality restored

## How Telemetry Informed This Design

The `/prd-next-telemetry-powered` analysis revealed critical insights that shaped our approach:

### 1. **Revealed Real Execution Flow**
Trace data showed: `context.gather_for_commit` (404ms) → `claude.collect_messages` (365ms) → `context.filter_messages` (0ms)
- The 0ms duration on `filter_messages` revealed filtering actually happens in the collector
- This informed where to insert session grouping logic

### 2. **Showed Current Filtering Patterns**
Logs revealed the two-stage filtering:
- "Filtered out 1183 messages (wrong project) + 29406 messages (outside time window)"
- "Filtered out 40 noisy messages (tool calls, system messages, empty content)"
- This informed our per-session filtering approach

### 3. **Validated Problem Impact**
- 16 successful journal generations this week
- But no sessionId filtering means potential contamination in every one
- Telemetry quantified the problem's real-world impact

### 4. **Guided Design Evolution Through Dialogue**
Our iterative discussion used telemetry insights to evolve from:
- Initial: Time-based "most recent activity" heuristics
- Problem: "We shouldn't be guessing about session relevance"
- Solution: Plan A (definitive signals) → Plan C (intelligent analysis)
- Architecture: Filter each session independently for clean AI comparison

The telemetry didn't just show us WHAT the system does, but HOW it does it - enabling a solution that fits naturally into the existing pipeline.

## Notes

- This PRD addresses a critical issue affecting journal quality and narrative coherence
- Solution leverages existing `sessionId` field in Claude Code messages
- Implementation preserves backward compatibility and existing workflow
- **Design informed by runtime telemetry analysis**: Used actual system behavior to guide architecture decisions
- Fallback mechanisms ensure journal generation never fails due to session detection issues
