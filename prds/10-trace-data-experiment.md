# PRD-10: Trace Data Integration Experiment for Claude Code

**GitHub Issue**: [#11](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/issues/11)
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: Medium
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks experimental phase
**Dependencies**: **PRD-6 M4 completion** (AI system intelligence validation) and foundation report in `docs/dev/prd-10-foundation.md`

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a systematic experiment to discover when and how runtime trace data from Datadog enhances Claude Code's effectiveness during development tasks. The goal is to build evidence-based patterns for whether trace integration improves code discovery, implementation decisions, and verification workflows.

## Context & Motivation

### Current State
Claude Code relies exclusively on static code analysis:
- Searches files for patterns and dependencies
- Analyzes code structure through imports and exports
- Makes assumptions about runtime behavior

### The Problem
Static analysis misses critical runtime context:
- **Actual data flow**: How data transforms through helper functions and middleware
- **Runtime dependencies**: Dynamic imports, conditional flows, event-driven patterns
- **Usage patterns**: Which code paths are actually executed in production
- **Verification gaps**: No confirmation that changes work as intended

### Real Example
When asked to "modify data going into a generator function," Claude Code might:
- **Current approach**: Modify the generator directly
- **Better approach**: Trace data flow upstream to find existing helper functions
- **Result**: Missed reuse opportunities and code duplication

### Opportunity
Leverage existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation and Datadog MCP server to enhance Claude Code's architectural awareness through runtime insights.

### PRD-6 M4 Foundation
This experiment builds on technical validation from **PRD-6 M4: AI System Intelligence Validation**:
- **Technical Feasibility**: PRD-6 M4 proves AI can query trace data via MCP and extract actionable insights
- **Instrumentation Patterns**: PRD-6 M4 documents optimal I/O data capture strategies for AI analysis
- **Performance Baselines**: PRD-6 M4 establishes overhead thresholds for production consideration
- **Foundation Document**: `docs/dev/prd-10-foundation.md` contains PRD-6 M4 findings, failure modes, and recommended experiment triggers

## Success Criteria

1. **Clear Evidence**: Documented patterns of when traces add value vs noise
2. **Measurable Impact**: >40% of trace consultations provide actionable insights
3. **Workflow Integration**: Seamless enhancement without disrupting development
4. **Decision Framework**: Clear go/no-go criteria for permanent integration
5. **Reusable Patterns**: Documented approaches applicable to other AI coding tools

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Discovery Framework
**Purpose**: Systematic approach to testing trace value

**Components**:
- Trace consultation triggers for specific task types
- Structured logging of consultation attempts
- Value assessment methodology
- Pattern identification system

#### 2. Integration Points
**Purpose**: Test trace data in real workflows

**Target Workflows**:
- Code exploration and discovery
- Implementation planning
- Progress verification
- Debugging and troubleshooting

#### 3. Evidence Collection
**Purpose**: Build data-driven integration decision

**Metrics to Track**:
- Success/failure rates by task type
- Value assessment (High/Medium/Low/None)
- Time impact (helpful vs overhead)
- Specific examples of prevented mistakes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Non-disruptive**: Experiments don't break existing workflows
- **Observable**: Clear logging of what traces revealed
- **Reversible**: Easy to disable if not valuable
- **Performant**: Minimal overhead from trace queries

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Experiment Design
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] **Review PRD-6 M4 foundation document** (`docs/dev/prd-10-foundation.md`) for validated patterns and baseline metrics
- [ ] Define trace consultation triggers **based on PRD-6 M4 task type analysis**
- [ ] Create logging framework **incorporating PRD-6 M4 performance thresholds**
- [ ] Establish value assessment criteria **using PRD-6 M4 success patterns as starting benchmarks**
- [ ] Document experiment protocol **referencing PRD-6 M4 instrumentation patterns and failure modes**

### Phase 2: Discovery Period
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Run development tasks with trace consultation
- [ ] Log all consultation attempts
- [ ] Track success and failure patterns
- [ ] Collect specific examples

### Phase 3: Analysis & Decision
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: High

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Analyze collected data
- [ ] Identify high-value patterns
- [ ] Document best practices
- [ ] Make go/no-go recommendation

### Phase 4: Integration Planning (If Go)
**Timeline**: TBD based on findings
**Priority**: Medium

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Design permanent integration approach
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap
- [ ] Define rollout strategy

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Trace data too noisy | Medium | High | Develop filtering strategies early |
| Performance overhead | Low | Medium | Cache queries, limit scope |
| Workflow disruption | Low | High | Keep consultation optional |
| Limited value discovery | Medium | High | Broad experimentation, multiple scenarios |

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Number of trace consultations attempted
- Success rate by task category
- Time saved vs time spent
- Mistakes prevented

### Qualitative
- Developer confidence improvements
- Code quality enhancements
- Architectural understanding gains
- Specific "aha moments" documented

## Work Log

### 2025-01-19: PRD Creation
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Activities**:
- Created GitHub issue #11
- Drafted PRD based on discovery discussion
- Aligned with existing PRD format and numbering

**Key Insights**:
- Trace data addresses "architectural blindness" in static analysis
- Failed consultations are valuable data about boundaries
- Integration should enhance, not replace existing workflows

**Next Steps**:
- Design experiment protocol
- Set up logging framework
- Begin discovery phase

## Open Questions

1. **Filtering**: How to effectively separate signal from noise in trace data?
2. **Automation**: Should consultation be automatic or user-triggered?
3. **Scope**: Which types of tasks should trigger trace consultation?
4. **Caching**: What's the optimal strategy for trace query performance?
5. **Validation**: How to verify trace insights are accurate?
