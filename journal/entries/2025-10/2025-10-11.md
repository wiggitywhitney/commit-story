### Summary - af074327

A new documentation file was added that provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and troubleshooting the Datadog MCP server, which is crucial for the project's telemetry needs. This guide details several challenges encountered during the setup process, including issues with access restrictions, authentication configuration, and timestamp formatting, along with the respective solutions. 

In the chat sessions, the developer explored various aspects of working with the Datadog MCP server, discussing the challenges faced in getting it connected, such as needing both an API key and an application key for authentication, and the importance of having access to the MCP server, which was in a preview state. The developer requested assistance in debugging steps, emphasizing the need to ensure the Datadog Agent was running and properly configured. They also planned to document these challenges and solutions to assist a friend who was struggling with similar issues.

Additionally, the developer expressed a desire to maintain clear communication by organizing the information effectively, even asking to delete unrelated files before committing the changes. This attention to detail is essential for ensuring that the documentation is not only useful for their friend but also serves as a valuable resource for future reference. Overall, the session encapsulated the complexities of integrating the Datadog MCP server while also reflecting on the learning journey through the debugging process.

### Development Dialogue - af074327

> **Human:** "I remember the MCP server being a little bit difficult to set up. Can you tell me what debugging steps I went through, from the journal?"

> **Assistant:** "Based on your journal entries, here are the **debugging steps you went through to get the Datadog MCP server working**: [...] The **retrospective from Sept 21** summarizes: *"3 hours debugging - first agent config issues, then timestamp overflow problems"* before finally getting everything working in Datadog on **September 20, 2025**."

> **Human:** "My friend is having trouble simply getting it connected. What were my challenges/solutions?"

> **Assistant:** "Based on your journal, here are the **specific challenges and solutions** you faced getting the Datadog MCP server connected: [...] Your friend should start by: [...]"

> **Human:** "I don't know why you are writing the expected logs as a git commit message. I don't git it. Also please delete the aarhus itenerary before the commit and push"

> **Assistant:** "You're right, that was confusing! Let me fix this properly."

### Technical Decisions - af074327

- **DECISION: Use Datadog Agent Instead of OTLP Endpoint** (Discussed)
  - Concluded that the Datadog Agent is preferable for the current project due to its integration with the Datadog MCP server.
  - Emphasized the importance of a vendor-neutral story for conference presentations.
  - Explored pros and cons of both approaches.
  Tradeoffs: Integration capabilities with the MCP server ultimately tipped the decision in favor of the Datadog Agent.
