### Summary - b56b9b13

The developer implemented session management for the context capture tool, featuring auto-detection of session IDs. This development focused on enhancing the journal generation process by automatically naming context entries based on the most recent session, which reduces the need for user intervention and minimizes cognitive load. The code changes included removing user-provided session naming, switching to a daily file structure for context captures, and creating a utility function to retrieve the current session ID from recent Claude Code messages.

During the discussions, the developer highlighted the importance of addressing potential data loss issues where repeated captures could overwrite previous entries. The AI assistant suggested the need for a plan that allows appending context captures rather than overwriting them. The developer ultimately decided to adopt a simpler naming convention that aligns with existing journal patterns, opting for a date-based format instead of user-defined session names. This change aims to streamline the context capture process and enhance usability.

In addition to the main implementation, the developer added a feature to display trace IDs during development mode for the reflection tool, improving debugging capabilities. This adjustment ensures that trace IDs can be easily accessed when testing the tool, which facilitates more effective demonstrations. Throughout the session, the developer maintained a focus on clean, organized code, confirming that all features functioned as intended before committing the changes.

The overall discussions also addressed the structure of the project moving forward. By breaking the implementation into smaller milestones, the developer emphasized the necessity of clear documentation and testing at each step, ensuring that the development process remains manageable and transparent. This strategic planning reflects a commitment to enhancing both functionality and user experience in the context capture tool.

### Development Dialogue - b56b9b13

> **Human:** "Yes"

No significant dialogue found for this development session.

### Technical Decisions - b56b9b13

- **DECISION: Enhance formatDateComponents with telemetry** (Implemented) - FILES: src/utils/journal-paths.js, src/telemetry/standards.js
  - Added metrics to demonstrate correlation of logs, metrics, traces
  - Updated function to follow semantic conventions for metrics
  - Included clear comments for instrumentation clarity
  Tradeoffs: Instrumentation is comprehensive but may be over-instrumented for production use.

- **DECISION: Context File Retention - Keep Forever** (Discussed)
  - Context files are kept indefinitely. Users manually delete files when no longer needed.
  - Simplicity: No auto-deletion logic, configuration, or edge cases to handle.
  - User control: Users decide what to keep, when to delete.
  - Low friction: Manual file deletion is trivial.
  - No surprises: Files never disappear unexpectedly.
  - Appropriate scope: Auto-deletion adds complexity for uncertain value.

- **DECISION: Milestone-Based Implementation Strategy** (Discussed)
  - Break Phase 1 into four incremental milestones instead of single monolithic implementation.
  - Incremental progress with testable checkpoints at each milestone.
  - Reduces risk by validating each piece before moving forward.
  - Easier to pause/resume work between milestones.
  - Clear definition of "done" for each step.

- **DECISION: Telemetry-Last Approach** (Discussed)
  - Implement core functionality first, add telemetry separately afterward.
  - Separates concerns: get feature working first, then add observability.
  - Reduces initial implementation complexity.
  - Allows focus on business logic without telemetry boilerplate.
  - Proven reflection-tool.js pattern available as reference when adding telemetry.

- **DECISION: Context Attribution** (Discussed)
  - "Context Files" section at end of journal entries with clickable links.

- **DECISION: DRY Code Reuse for Journal Integration** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/18-context-capture-tool.md
  - Generalize existing reflection discovery/parsing code for both reflections and context files
  - Prevent code duplication by using the same discovery/parsing logic with a type parameter
  - Ensure maintainability and reduced complexity through a single implementation
  Tradeoffs: If generalization proves complex, fall back to separate `discoverContext()` function.

- **DECISION: Add Dev Mode Trace ID Display for MCP Tools** (Implemented) - FILES: src/mcp/tools/reflection-tool.js
  - Provides trace ID for immediate Datadog queries
  - Only shows in dev mode (dev: true in config)
  - Same approach for all MCP tools (reflection, context)
  - Silent success in production, detailed feedback in development
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly mentioned.
