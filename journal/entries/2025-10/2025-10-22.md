### Summary - e890587a

The developer updated the README to include a new section on journal management and clarified the behavior of merge commits, specifically regarding how journal entries are handled when using `.gitignore`. During the chat, the developer and the assistant discussed various aspects of the project, particularly the user experience related to merge commits. The developer expressed concerns about whether users would face issues with journal entries being lost during merges, leading to a deeper exploration of the functionality.

The assistant confirmed that journal entries do persist locally despite being in `.gitignore`, thus allowing for personal growth without cluttering the team repository. They evaluated the implications of this setup, weighing the benefits of maintaining personal journals against the potential for losing valuable documentation for team collaboration. A critical analysis of the suggestion to recommend using `.gitignore` revealed that it contradicted the project's objective of preserving journal history for development context.

Ultimately, the developer decided to retain the current implementation while documenting the limitations, ensuring users understand how to manage journals effectively during merge scenarios. They agreed to update the README immediately, capturing these insights and tradeoffs for future users. The assistant facilitated the documentation process, ensuring the information was concise and relevant, and prepared to log this additional work in the project documentation.

### Development Dialogue - e890587a

> **Human:** "Actually, what is the user experience here? Will users of our journal project be able to seamlessly do merge commits without recursion problems or losing entries?"
> **Assistant:** "[...] The hook should run BEFORE the merge commit [...] This is still friction! [...]"

> **Human:** "capture context: capture what is good and what is still not working about our merge commit solution" 

> **Human:** "I think do nothing. Maybe update README to recommend keeping journals in .gitignore for more complex git workflows? What do you think? Be critical"
> **Assistant:** "[...] The entire point of PRD-32 is to *fix* journal filtering so journals CAN be tracked in git [...]" 

> **Human:** "Yes. Should we update the README now while all this is fresh?"

### Technical Decisions - e890587a

- **DECISION: Update README with Journal Management Section** (Discussed)
  - Documented default behavior of journals in .gitignore
  - Explained merge commit behavior when journals are tracked
  - Clarified that journals persist locally across branches when ignored
  - Provided workaround for merge commits with conflicts (manual amend)

I like art a lot, especially modern art and local art. I love nature and hikes and bike rides. I enjoy science and animals. I especially love quirky, offbeat experiences. First recommend some activities to me, then I'll choose some and we can think about an itenerary."
