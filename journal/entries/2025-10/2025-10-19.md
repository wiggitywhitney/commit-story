### Summary - 340c8611

The developer refined the hybrid merge commit handling strategy by updating the documentation for DD-016 to include a diff check for merge commits. This enhancement specifies that journal generation should be skipped only if a merge commit is both silent (no chat activity) and clean (no diff), allowing for journal entries to be created for merges that involve chat or meaningful code changes. 

The discussions revolved around identifying and addressing a gap in the initial implementation of DD-016, where merge commits with substantial code changes but no chat would be skipped, losing important context from silent conflict resolutions. The developer considered various approaches to improve the strategy, ultimately deciding that any non-empty diff should trigger journal generation. This decision stems from the understanding that merge commit diffs typically reflect significant development work, particularly in the case of conflict resolutions.

Through the conversation, the developer and the AI assistant explored different thresholds for determining what constitutes a meaningful diff, weighing the pros and cons of simple boolean checks versus more complex threshold-based approaches. The conclusion was to adopt a straightforward logic that checks for any non-empty diff, ensuring that even minor changes in merge commits are not overlooked. 

Tasks were updated to reflect this new logic, and a work log entry was added to document the design refinement process. This work sets the stage for the next implementation phase, focusing on testing and validating these changes.

### Development Dialogue - 340c8611

> **Human:** "Question. Would a merge commit with a meaningful code diff but not much chat be worth making an entry about?"
> **Assistant:** "[...] This reveals a potential gap in the DD-016 strategy. Let me think through this scenario: [...] we'd lose context about HOW and WHY conflicts were resolved, even though significant development work happened."

> **Human:** "I think 2. I think should any diff trigger journal? That is easiest. Or, if it should be more, it could be about # of lines or code v documentation. Maybe # of lines? I don't know. Any diff over 10 characters? What do you think?"

### Technical Decisions - 340c8611

- **DECISION: Hybrid Merge Commit Handling - Skip Only Silent, Clean Merges** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/32-journal-filter.md
  - Skip journal generation for merge commits ONLY when there is BOTH no chat activity AND no diff (empty merge).
  - Generate journals for merges with AI conversation OR code changes.
  - Updated rationale to include both chat activity and diff presence as signals for "significant merge work" to prevent losing context from silent conflict resolutions.

- **DECISION: Any Non-Empty Diff Threshold** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/32-journal-filter.md
  - For merge commits, any non-empty diff indicates meaningful changes (conflict resolution or integration code).
  - Simplest boolean check is the most conservative approach to avoid missing context from silent conflict resolutions.
