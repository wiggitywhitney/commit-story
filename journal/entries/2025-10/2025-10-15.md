### Summary - f26ea0ba

The developer implemented changes to enhance the context capture tool by fixing user experience issues related to its two-mode functionality. This involved revising the way the tool interprets user requests for capturing context, allowing it to provide either a comprehensive dump or specific content based on user input without requiring multiple interactions. The previous implementation necessitated a round-trip interaction that felt cumbersome, so the developer decided to streamline the process by embedding guidance directly within the tool's description. This adjustment means that when users request specific context, the AI can generate the appropriate response in a single call, improving efficiency and usability.

During the sessions leading up to this change, the developer and AI assistant explored the operational context of the tool and discussed the pros and cons of the existing two-mode system, which included a comprehensive dump mode and a direct capture mode. They recognized that the previous flow, where the AI needed to ask for a prompt before generating a response, created an awkward user experience. The developer articulated the need for the tool to provide context without unnecessary delays, leading to the conclusion that the guidance should be incorporated into the tool's description. This allows the AI to interpret user requests intuitively and respond appropriately without extra steps.

Additionally, the developer removed arbitrary character limits on context captures, enhancing the tool's flexibility, and ensured that the tool would always append context entries to daily journal files. They also took care to document the evolution of their design decisions, noting that while the core functionality remained the same, the implementation approach had shifted for clarity and efficiency.

Conversations during the session revealed critical insights into the importance of maintaining a clear and user-friendly interaction model, and the developer's focus on usability led to significant improvements in the context capture tool's functionality. As the session wrapped up, the developer committed the changes and prepared for the necessary validation of the updated modes, ensuring that both comprehensive and specific captures would work seamlessly.

### Development Dialogue - f26ea0ba

> **Human:** "Although that worked, as a user, the flow felt a bit silly. I think the AI assistant needs to see that prompt 'Provide a comprehensive context capture of your current understanding of this project, recent development insights, and key context that would help a fresh AI understand where we are and how we got here' internally somewhere and then provide the right test from the get-go, during the first tool call."
> **Assistant:** "Excellent feedback! You're absolutely right - the two-step round-trip feels clunky as a user experience. [...] **The better approach**: Put the comprehensive prompt guidance directly in the **tool description** so the AI sees it upfront and can provide the right text in a single call."

> **Human:** "Yes I want to fix it. I am very attached to this prompt that gives a good context dump: 'Provide a comprehensive context capture of your current understanding of this project, recent development insights, and key context that would help a fresh AI understand where we are and how we got here' - do not modify it."

> **Human:** "Don't change the dump prompt. But there needs to be an if/then scenario. If the user asks to capture context about something specific, capture the context about that thing. Otherwise, <<dump prompt>>."
> **Assistant:** "Perfect! So the tool description should guide the AI's decision-making upfront: [...] **Always one call**, no round-trip."

### Technical Decisions - f26ea0ba

- **DECISION: Implement Flexible Two-Mode Context Capture** (Implemented) - FILES: src/mcp/tools/context-capture-tool.js, src/mcp/server.js
  - Mode 1 (Comprehensive Dump): Omitted text triggers comprehensive prompt
  - Mode 2 (Direct Capture): Specific text writes immediately to file
  - AI interprets user intent naturally

- **DECISION: Remove Arbitrary Character Limits** (Implemented) - FILES: src/mcp/tools/context-capture-tool.js
  - No technical justification for the 10,000 character limit
  - File system handles large files easily
  - Users can manage file sizes naturally

- **DECISION: Rename context-tool.js to context-capture-tool.js** (Implemented) - FILES: src/mcp/tools/context-capture-tool.js
  - Avoids confusion with other context usages (OpenTelemetry context, React context, etc.)

- **DECISION: Update Tool Description for Context Capture** (Implemented) - FILES: src/mcp/server.js
  - Tool description now includes comprehensive prompt guidance with if/then logic
  - Simplifies user experience by eliminating unnecessary round-trip for context capture
