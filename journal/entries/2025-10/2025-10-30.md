### Summary - 85935521

The developer added a new file containing an abstract for a talk titled "Taming Telemetry Standards: Adopting OpenTelemetry Weaver in Production," which outlines the challenges and potential benefits of using OpenTelemetry Weaver to manage telemetry standards in their project. The abstract emphasizes the issues currently faced, such as maintaining a lengthy documentation file and the lack of enforcement for telemetry standards, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors in production.

In the preceding chat sessions, the developer discussed various aspects of their telemetry implementation, highlighting frustrations with the current system, particularly the cumbersome nature of the existing standards documentation and the manual process of enforcing telemetry conventions. They expressed interest in adopting OpenTelemetry Weaver to streamline telemetry management, facilitate better documentation, and improve overall developer experience. The developer also considered the implications of using Weaver on their project, weighing its benefits against the complexities it might introduce.

During the conversations, the developer reflected on the importance of standardizing telemetry practices and ensuring that new contributions adhere to established conventions. They articulated a desire to present their findings and experiences after adopting Weaver, aiming to share practical insights about the transition from a best-effort approach to a more structured telemetry management system. This personal journey was framed as a way to communicate the real-world challenges and solutions encountered throughout the refactoring process.

### Development Dialogue - 85935521

> **Human:** "I want to make a talk abstract around the idea of adopting Weaver. like, 'I'm using telemetry but it is not the best because x. I am going to adopt Weaver and record my trials and tribulations and benefits and I'll deliver them in this talk.'"

> **Assistant:** "[...] Here's a draft abstract that positions it as a practical journey: [...] I'll walk through: [...] the trials: Wrestling with schema design, generating consistent instrumentation, validating at runtime [...]"

> **Human:** "I want it to be more personal. I tried managing telemetry and ran into these problems (what is not great about my telemetry rn? For one thing the fact that I have to package otel sdk w my app [...] so I'm going to try out OpenTelemetry Weaver. Here are the benefits I hope to get. When I deliver this talk I'll report back about the trials & tribulations of refactoring for adoption and whether the effort was worth it."

> **Assistant:** "[...] managing it is a mess. [...] So I'm adopting OpenTelemetry Weaver as an experiment. [...] This talk follows my real refactoring journey: [...] I'll report back with real traces, git diffs, and lessons from refactoring an existing codebase for Weaver adoption."

### Technical Decisions - 85935521

- **DECISION: Adoption of OpenTelemetry Weaver for Telemetry Management** (Discussed) - FILES: abstracts/weaver-telemetry-standards.md
  - Current telemetry management is cumbersome with a 380-line documentation file.
  - No enforcement of standards leads to inconsistencies in instrumentation.
  - Weaver could standardize semantic conventions and automate validation.
  - The goal is to improve developer experience and manage telemetry effectively.

### Developer Reflections - 85935521

**5:31:24 PM CDT**

I really like this observability guide: https://github.com/vfarcic/dot-ai/blob/main/docs/observability-guide.md and am interested in doing something similar for commit-story

**5:35:06 PM CDT**

I'd like to explore the idea of using OpenTelemetry Weaver to help manage telemetry standards in this codebase
