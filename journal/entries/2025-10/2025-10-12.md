### Summary - 3b3fd31a

The developer marked PRD-2 as "Not Planning to Implement" and deferred PRD-31 until after November 15, 2025, as reflected in the documentation updates. During the discussions, the developer identified a critical architectural issue regarding package management, noting that the current setup results in 93 packages being installed for all users, even for those who do not utilize the MCP tools, which might be excessive for new users. The developer expressed a decision against implementing PRD-2, feeling it wasn't a problem worth addressing for personal use. The session also included efforts to analyze and prioritize ongoing projects, with the assistant providing insights on the current state of the system and recommending the next highest-priority task based on telemetry data.
