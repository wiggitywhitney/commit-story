The developer also confirmed the use of synthetic test traces for the discovery phase, which would facilitate understanding without interfering with production code.

In summary, the session culminated in a clearer plan for the project's next steps, enhancing documentation strategies, and laying the groundwork for future development work, all while maintaining a careful approach to preserving existing information in the project documentation.

### Development Dialogue - a2c04881

**Human:** "I think this is in the @docs/dev/otel-ai-verification-concept.md doc, but the importance of this step is to validate my concept and document learnings to help me properly instrument the full Commit Story project so that traces can be used (a) for AI assistant discovery and (b) to validate new code that the AI assistant writes. Please read the doc. Should this new information change your plan at all?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, after reading the document, I should update my plan. The key insight is that this M3 milestone is about **validating the concept and documenting learnings** to inform how you'll instrument the entire Commit Story project. This is a proof-of-concept phase focused on learning, not just implementation."

**Human:** "Yes I approve but should we document this somewhere? In the PRD perhaps? I will have to leave the computer soon."

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, let's document this plan in the PRD before starting implementation. I'll add it to the M3 section now."

**Human:** "Please verify that no important information from the old prd file is lost."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're right to check. Let me compare the old and new content to ensure nothing important is lost."

**Human:** "Now it seems that you lost a lot of information from the proposed update."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right! I was trying to be too conservative and lost the detailed implementation plan. Let me create a proper update that:

1. **Keeps all original content** (deliverables, technical requirements, acceptance criteria, cleanup requirements)
2. **Adds the detailed implementation plan** we discussed."

**Human:** "I also think there should be a discovery phase about the Datadog MCP server and what's available from there. Do you agree? Be critical."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right, and I should have been more thorough. Looking critically at the plan, we're making a big assumption that we know what the Datadog MCP server provides without actually exploring it first."

**Human:** "Okay great! Let's make a plan and update the PRD with that plan, being careful to preserve any important/relevant parts from the existing PRD."

### Development Dialogue - 411cc7c1

**Human:** "There is a datadog API key in there. I have not made an APP key yet."

**Assistant:** "[...] Thanks for clarifying! You have the API key but need an APP key. Let me help you create the Datadog Application Key first, then we can configure the MCP server."

**Human:** "I made the App key and stored it in GCP secrets manager and referenced it in teller secrets configuration. From there you can create the .mcp.json, yeah?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Perfect! Yes, I can create the `.mcp.json` file now that you have both keys available through Teller. Let me create the MCP configuration file."

**Human:** "This is too much about process. It just should be about hard data. What we actually know."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're right - let me focus on the hard data and actual findings."

**Human:** "No the tools need to be validated after the actual MCP server is installed. They need to be validated and understood w MCP server. Also I want to document the shape of the data."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right. The tool inventory and capabilities can only be properly documented after the MCP server is actually running and we can test the real tools and see the actual data formats they return."

**Human:** "Does the PRD make it clear to a fresh AI that the MCP server will be restarted and direct validation needs to happen?"

**Assistant:** "[...] It's decent but could be clearer. Let me make it more explicit for a fresh AI."

**Human:** "Great. Now you can git add, commit, push please."
