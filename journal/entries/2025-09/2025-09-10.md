### Summary - a2c04881

In this development session, the developer made significant updates focused on enhancing the planning for milestone M3 and M4 of the OpenTelemetry project, specifically around the AI System Intelligence Integration. The primary commit, which was described as "feat(prd-6): enhance M3/M4 milestone planning with strategic documentation focus," resulted in changes across five files. Key modifications included the addition of new content to the project documentation and updates to code files to support these planning efforts.

The developer began by reinforcing the importance of documenting the current state and planned approach for M3, emphasizing that this phase centers on "validating the concept and documenting learnings." This led to a discussion about the need to revise the implementation plan to ensure it matched the project's goals. The developer proposed a structured approach, identifying that the first milestone (M3) should focus on research and discovery regarding the Datadog MCP server, while the subsequent milestone (M4) would be dedicated to validating the concept with a proof-of-concept implementation.

Throughout the chat, there were exchanges regarding how to best preserve existing documentation while integrating new information. The importance of maintaining original deliverables and technical requirements from previous project documents was highlighted, ensuring no critical information was lost during updates.

As the session progressed, the developer realized the necessity of distinguishing between the exploration phase (M3) and the validation phase (M4). This distinction was deemed vital for clarity, allowing for more focused work and reducing the risk of making incorrect assumptions about the tools available. The developer also confirmed the use of synthetic test traces for the discovery phase, which would facilitate understanding without interfering with production code.

In summary, the session culminated in a clearer plan for the project's next steps, enhancing documentation strategies, and laying the groundwork for future development work, all while maintaining a careful approach to preserving existing information in the project documentation.

### Development Dialogue - a2c04881

**Human:** "I think this is in the @docs/dev/otel-ai-verification-concept.md doc, but the importance of this step is to validate my concept and document learnings to help me properly instrument the full Commit Story project so that traces can be used (a) for AI assistant discovery and (b) to validate new code that the AI assistant writes. Please read the doc. Should this new information change your plan at all?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, after reading the document, I should update my plan. The key insight is that this M3 milestone is about **validating the concept and documenting learnings** to inform how you'll instrument the entire Commit Story project. This is a proof-of-concept phase focused on learning, not just implementation."

**Human:** "Yes I approve but should we document this somewhere? In the PRD perhaps? I will have to leave the computer soon."

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, let's document this plan in the PRD before starting implementation. I'll add it to the M3 section now."

**Human:** "Please verify that no important information from the old prd file is lost."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're right to check. Let me compare the old and new content to ensure nothing important is lost."

**Human:** "Now it seems that you lost a lot of information from the proposed update."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right! I was trying to be too conservative and lost the detailed implementation plan. Let me create a proper update that:

1. **Keeps all original content** (deliverables, technical requirements, acceptance criteria, cleanup requirements)
2. **Adds the detailed implementation plan** we discussed."

**Human:** "I also think there should be a discovery phase about the Datadog MCP server and what's available from there. Do you agree? Be critical."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right, and I should have been more thorough. Looking critically at the plan, we're making a big assumption that we know what the Datadog MCP server provides without actually exploring it first."

**Human:** "Okay great! Let's make a plan and update the PRD with that plan, being careful to preserve any important/relevant parts from the existing PRD."

### Technical Decisions - a2c04881

- **DECISION: Document M3/M4 Milestone Split** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/6-otel-mvp-setup.md
  - The developer proposed a clearer separation of concerns between research and validation phases.
  - M3 focuses on exploration and documentation of the Datadog MCP server.
  - M4 is dedicated to building and validating the proof-of-concept based on M3 findings.

- **DECISION: Update PRD with Detailed Implementation Plan** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/6-otel-mvp-setup.md
  - The developer emphasized the need to document the implementation plan in the PRD.
  - Ensured that important elements from the original PRD are preserved during the update.
  - The plan includes a structured approach to connect, explore, and document capabilities of the MCP server.

- **DECISION: Conduct MCP Server Discovery Phase** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/6-otel-mvp-setup.md
  - The assistant identified the need for a discovery phase to validate assumptions about the Datadog MCP server.
  - This phase will explore available tools and capabilities before proceeding with implementation.
  - It aligns with the objective of validating concepts and documenting learnings.

- **DECISION: Use Synthetic Test Traces for MCP Discovery** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/6-otel-mvp-setup.md
  - The assistant suggested using existing synthetic test traces for initial exploration of the MCP server.
  - This approach allows for safe learning without impacting production code.
  - It sets the stage for later validation with more realistic scenarios.

- **DECISION: Document Full I/O Data Collection Strategy** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/6-otel-mvp-setup.md
  - The developer highlighted the importance of collecting full I/O data at key points in the data flow.
  - This documentation will aid in AI-assisted discovery and validation of new code.
  - It emphasizes the need for thorough instrumentation throughout the project.
