### Development Dialogue - a2c04881

**Human:** "I think this is in the @docs/dev/otel-ai-verification-concept.md doc, but the importance of this step is to validate my concept and document learnings to help me properly instrument the full Commit Story project so that traces can be used (a) for AI assistant discovery and (b) to validate new code that the AI assistant writes. Please read the doc. Should this new information change your plan at all?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, after reading the document, I should update my plan. The key insight is that this M3 milestone is about **validating the concept and documenting learnings** to inform how you'll instrument the entire Commit Story project. This is a proof-of-concept phase focused on learning, not just implementation."

**Human:** "Yes I approve but should we document this somewhere? In the PRD perhaps? I will have to leave the computer soon."

**Assistant:** "[...] Yes, let's document this plan in the PRD before starting implementation. I'll add it to the M3 section now."

**Human:** "Please verify that no important information from the old prd file is lost."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're right to check. Let me compare the old and new content to ensure nothing important is lost."

**Human:** "Now it seems that you lost a lot of information from the proposed update."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right! I was trying to be too conservative and lost the detailed implementation plan. Let me create a proper update that:

1. **Keeps all original content** (deliverables, technical requirements, acceptance criteria, cleanup requirements)
2. **Adds the detailed implementation plan** we discussed."

**Human:** "I also think there should be a discovery phase about the Datadog MCP server and what's available from there. Do you agree? Be critical."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right, and I should have been more thorough. Looking critically at the plan, we're making a big assumption that we know what the Datadog MCP server provides without actually exploring it first."

**Human:** "Okay great! Let's make a plan and update the PRD with that plan, being careful to preserve any important/relevant parts from the existing PRD."

### Development Dialogue - 411cc7c1

**Human:** "There is a datadog API key in there. I have not made an APP key yet."

**Assistant:** "[...] Thanks for clarifying! You have the API key but need an APP key. Let me help you create the Datadog Application Key first, then we can configure the MCP server."

**Human:** "I made the App key and stored it in GCP secrets manager and referenced it in teller secrets configuration. From there you can create the .mcp.json, yeah?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Perfect! Yes, I can create the `.mcp.json` file now that you have both keys available through Teller. Let me create the MCP configuration file."

**Human:** "This is too much about process. It just should be about hard data. What we actually know."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're right - let me focus on the hard data and actual findings."

**Human:** "No the tools need to be validated after the actual MCP server is installed. They need to be validated and understood w MCP server. Also I want to document the shape of the data."

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right. The tool inventory and capabilities can only be properly documented after the MCP server is actually running and we can test the real tools and see the actual data formats they return."

**Human:** "Does the PRD make it clear to a fresh AI that the MCP server will be restarted and direct validation needs to happen?"

**Assistant:** "[...] It's decent but could be clearer. Let me make it more explicit for a fresh AI."

**Human:** "Great. Now you can git add, commit, push please."

This included significant code changes as reflected in the git commit noted as "feat(prd-6): cleanup community MCP server work, prepare for official server."

The primary changes involved the deletion of two files: `.mcp.json` and `docs/dev/mcp-research-findings.md`. The former contained configurations for the community MCP server, including commands and environment variables for Datadog, while the latter documented research findings that were no longer relevant given the shift to the official server.

Throughout the session, the developer engaged in various discussions regarding the transition to the official server, emphasizing the importance of maintaining clarity in documentation and project requirements. They noted that while the cleanup was crucial, much of the process developed in the earlier work could still be preserved, such as the test traces generated and the validation processes.

The developer confirmed that they had created a Datadog Application Key, which was stored securely in Google Secret Manager. This was a critical step in ensuring the new setup would function properly. The session also featured discussions to ensure documentation accurately reflected the current state of the project and outlined next steps, including the necessity to wait for access to the official Datadog MCP server before proceeding with further validations.

At one point, the developer recognized the need to revise their approach after realizing that they had mistakenly presented the M3 status as complete when it was, in fact, still blocked pending access to the official server. They promptly updated the project requirements document (PRD) to reflect this status and committed the changes to ensure their work was documented properly.

Overall, the session was productive as the developer laid the groundwork for the next steps with a clear focus on documentation and process integrity while transitioning from a community-based to an official server setup. The developer is now waiting for access to the official Datadog MCP server to proceed with the project.
