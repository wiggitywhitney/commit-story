### Summary - 83d0a86d

In this development session, the developer focused on enhancing the documentation and planning for implementing OpenTelemetry semantic conventions across the project. The main output was a commit that added a comprehensive analysis of OpenTelemetry semantic conventions to the existing documentation file.

The file modified was `prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md`, where several key decisions and rationales were documented, particularly regarding the need to standardize the usage of OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. The developer recognized inconsistencies in the existing telemetry data, noting that mixed conventions were being used, such as both `ai.*` and `gen_ai.*` attributes. They decided to address this by proposing a semantic convention consistency audit and comprehensive instrumentation for data collection components.

The developer engaged in a thorough analysis of the codebase to identify files that lacked OpenTelemetry instrumentation. They categorized the files into several groups, including those already instrumented and those that needed instrumentation due to containing significant business logic. Specifically, five key files that handle data collection and processing were identified as needing OpenTelemetry instrumentation to improve observability.

A significant part of the session involved discussing the need for a comprehensive research phase to ensure that all telemetry attributes align with the latest OpenTelemetry standards. This included planning to conduct a thorough audit of the codebase, review relevant OpenTelemetry documentation, and create a migration plan for transitioning existing custom attributes to standardized forms.

The developer then updated the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to reflect these findings and plans, adding new design decisions focused on enhancing semantic convention compliance and instrumentation. They included a detailed implementation plan for the upcoming changes, which emphasized the need for thorough research before any alterations are made.

Finally, the developer committed the updates to the PRD, ensuring that the work was saved and ready for further review or implementation. This session highlighted the importance of adhering to OpenTelemetry standards for better data consistency and compatibility with monitoring tools, as well as the commitment to maintaining high-quality observability across the project.

### Development Dialogue - 83d0a86d

**Human:** "Please analyze all code and tell me whether there is any that is not instrumented with OpenTelemetry"

**Assistant:** "[...] I'll analyze your codebase to identify code that is not instrumented with OpenTelemetry. Let me start by examining the project structure and then checking each file for OpenTelemetry instrumentation."

**Human:** "I need you to analyze JavaScript files to identify which ones lack OpenTelemetry instrumentation. 

Here is the complete list of JavaScript files in the project (excluding node_modules): [...] 

For each category, list the files and explain briefly why they fall into that category."

**Assistant:** "[...] I'll analyze all the JavaScript files to identify their OpenTelemetry instrumentation status. Let me examine each file systematically."

**Human:** "Question. Otel semantic conventions are for everything, right? Not just GenAI? Are we using semantic conventions for ALL of the data we're collecting with Otel?"

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right - OpenTelemetry semantic conventions cover EVERYTHING, not just GenAI. Let me analyze the current instrumentation to see if we're following semantic conventions for all telemetry data:"

**Human:** "Yes but add a research stage where the code is thoroughly reviewed, every file. And the latest Otel documentation is checked and compared. I want this to be thorough and up-to-date. Don't do the research and analysis now. Write it into the plan to do later."

**Assistant:** "[...] Excellent approach! You're right - we need a thorough research phase before making changes. Let me add DD-011 with a comprehensive research stage to the PRD:"

**Human:** "commit and push"

**Assistant:** "[...] I'll commit and push the PRD updates for you."

### Technical Decisions - 83d0a86d

- **DECISION: Semantic Convention Consistency Audit** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md
  - Identified mixed conventions in instrumented files.
  - Inconsistency makes telemetry data harder to query and analyze.
  - OpenTelemetry best practice is consistent attribute naming.

- **DECISION: Comprehensive Collector Instrumentation** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md
  - Data collectors are critical path operations with no visibility.
  - Need metrics on data collection performance for optimization.
  - Ensures complete end-to-end observability.

- **DECISION: Full OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention Compliance** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md
  - Currently using custom attribute names that don't follow OTel standards.
  - Non-standard attributes reduce compatibility with observability tools.
  - Standards compliance ensures telemetry data is portable across platforms.

- **DECISION: Research Stage Required for Compliance** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md
  - Comprehensive code audit to catalog all attribute names.
  - Review latest OTel semantic conventions.
  - Create mapping table of current vs. standard conventions.

- **DECISION: Update Phase 2 Implementation Plan** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/7-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md
  - Added tasks for semantic convention consistency and collector instrumentation.
  - Prioritized fixing existing issues before adding new instrumentation.
  - Estimated time for implementation increased to include research phase.
