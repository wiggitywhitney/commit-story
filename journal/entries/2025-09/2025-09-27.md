## 6:56:21 AM EDT - Commit: 57f22981 - feat(prd-25): update session isolation design with telemetry-informed decisions

### Summary - 57f22981

During this development session, the developer focused on refining the session isolation design, leveraging insights from telemetry data to inform their decisions. The primary file modified was `prds/25-session-isolation.md`, where significant updates were made to the design decisions and implementation plans around session handling.

The session began with the developer reviewing ongoing issues related to session contamination in the journal entries when multiple Claude Code tabs were open. Previous discussions had led to the draft of PRD-25, aimed at addressing this problem by utilizing the existing `sessionId` field to detect which conversation was active when each commit was made.

In this session, the developer dove into telemetry data to better understand the execution flow. They analyzed how the system functions, noting that filtering takes place primarily in `claude-collector.js`, rather than in the later `context.filter_messages` function, which was originally misinterpreted to be where the filtering occurred. This misunderstanding was rectified through a deeper look into the narrative logs and trace data, revealing that the actual filtering processes were happening in the collector, which handles heavy lifting and filtering by project and time.

The developer and the AI assistant discussed various approaches to ensure the correct session was associated with commits. The conversation emphasized the importance of validating session data without making guesses based on heuristics. The final consensus was to implement a "Plan A → Plan C" approach, where the last message of a session is checked for a git commit signal (Plan A), and if not found, AI would be utilized to analyze the session context against the git diff to identify the relevant contributions (Plan C).

Throughout the discussion, the importance of telemetry was highlighted, demonstrating how it guided the developer from potential missteps based on static analysis to a more effective architectural solution. The developer reflected on how, without telemetry, they would have likely placed session logic in the wrong part of the system, thus missing the opportunity for a more elegant integration.

By the end of the session, the developer updated PRD-25 with the newly agreed-upon design decisions, clarified how telemetry informed these choices, and committed the changes to the repository. The session showcased a clear evolution of thought, emphasizing the value of telemetry in understanding system behavior and making informed design choices.

### Development Dialogue - 57f22981

**Human:** "Look at telemetry data from the past week and from that alone draw me a diagram of this system works."

**Assistant:** "[...] I'll analyze telemetry data from the past week to understand how this system works and create a diagram for you."

**Human:** "I think the session id should be validated. Perhaps by checking that the last chat message from either the user or assistant is a git commit message. Except what if the user git commits from the terminal. Hmmm. Think this through with me. I don't think we should be guessing about the session id."

**Human:** "Plan A -> Plan B1 -> Plan C which is to invoke an AI instance to intelligently choose which of the two conversations is relevant to the code changes in question. What do you think? Maybe omit B1 since that is falliable."

**Human:** "Let's not overcomplicate. Each sessionid is its own thread, all or nothing. Plan A is checking that the last chat message from either the user or assistant is a git commit message. What is plan b?"

**Human:** "Are you just telling me what I want to hear?"

**Human:** "The correlated traces & logs showed filtering happens in the collector at lines 80-94, so that's where session grouping needed to happen, not in the later context integration step (context.filter_messages). Most filtering is in claude-collector.js (project/time filtering). With trace data alone, AI first assumed filtering happens at context.filter_messages but that function only does lightweight noise filtering. I also think AI would have rewritten the funtionality altogether had it not been for telemetry data."

**Human:** "This is what AI would have happened without telemetry: Static Analysis Path: 1. I would have started in context-integrator.js because that's clearly the orchestration layer that calls everything else. It's the most obvious place to add new logic."

### Technical Decisions - 57f22981

- **DECISION: Session Detection Strategy** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/25-session-isolation.md
  - **Rationale**: Automatic detection based on recent message activity was initially considered.
  - **Final Choice**: Shifted to validation-based selection using definitive signals (git commit presence) and AI content analysis.
  - **Reason for Change**: Telemetry analysis revealed that "most recent activity" heuristics would fail for terminal commits and parallel workflows.
  - **Tradeoffs**: Original approach may have led to incorrect session selection; new approach aims for accuracy.

- **DECISION: Selection Algorithm** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/25-session-isolation.md
  - **Rationale**: Initially proposed a simple heuristic based on the most recent message timestamp.
  - **Final Choice**: Adopted a Plan A → Plan C approach, checking for definitive signals first, then using AI for analysis.
  - **Reason for Change**: Simplifies the process and avoids unreliable heuristics.
  - **Tradeoffs**: Skipping intermediate checks may lead to missing some relevant sessions but improves overall accuracy.

- **DECISION: Fallback Behavior** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/25-session-isolation.md
  - **Rationale**: If session detection fails, the original plan was to use all messages.
  - **Final Choice**: If no valid session is found, skip journal generation entirely.
  - **Reason for Change**: Ensures journal quality and avoids contamination from irrelevant sessions.
  - **Tradeoffs**: May result in fewer journal entries but improves accuracy and relevance.

- **DECISION: Per-Session Noise Filtering** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/25-session-isolation.md
  - **Rationale**: Initial filtering was done collectively, leading to potential contamination.
  - **Final Choice**: Apply noise filtering to each session independently before selection.
  - **Reason for Change**: Telemetry logs indicated that filtering should happen per-session for clean AI comparison.
  - **Tradeoffs**: More processing per session but leads to higher quality data for AI analysis.

- **DECISION: Telemetry-Informed Design** (Discussed) - FILES: prds/25-session-isolation.md
  - **Rationale**: Initial assumptions about filtering locations were incorrect.
  - **Final Insight**: Telemetry revealed the actual filtering process and where to implement session logic.
  - **Reason for Change**: Understanding the execution path allowed for more accurate architectural decisions.
  - **Tradeoffs**: Without telemetry, the design could have been less optimal, leading to potential architectural debt.

### Developer Reflections - 57f22981

**1:13:53 PM EDT**

To demo what the AI coding assistant can understand from telemetry data alone, I think the prompt can be something like "Look at telemetry data from the past week and from that alone draw me a diagram of this system works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated"  - I tried it without specifying that correlation is available and that made for a lower quality response

**6:32:13 AM EDT**

I just had a great design conversation with my assistant where telemetry really helped. I'm attempting to capture it here. 
Me: The chat goes through some filtering/processing before reaching generator functions. Do we do that filtering on both chats and then let the ai invocation decide? Use trace data to understand the execution path.
Assistant: [[makes a plan with execution path data]]
Assistant casually also says: What's interesting is that the current context.filter_messages shows 0ms duration.
Me: Oh? What do the narrative logs say?

**6:41:47 AM EDT**

The correlated traces & logs showed filtering happens in the collector at lines 80-94, so that's where session grouping needed to happen, not in the later context integration step (context.filter_messages). Most filtering is in claude-collector.js (project/time filtering). With trace data alone, AI first assumed filtering happens at context.filter_messages but that function only does lightweight noise filtering.
I also think AI would have rewritten the funtionality altogether had it not been for telemetry data. So it went like:
(1) no trace data: write duplicated functionality, or maybe reached same conclusion as #2 because of keyword match
(2) traces alone: AI sees a function with the keyword "filter_messages", assumes it should happen there
(3) correlated traces + logs: AI finds the right spot to add the logic!

**6:52:45 AM EDT**

This is what AI would have happened without telemetry: Static Analysis Path:
  1. I would have started in context-integrator.js because that's clearly the orchestration layer that calls everything
  else. It's the most obvious place to add new logic.
  2. I would have seen the extractChatForCommit() call and probably thought "this is where I need to add session logic" -
   which would have been closer to correct.
  3. But I likely would have wrapped it externally rather than modifying the collector internally:
  // Probably would have done this (suboptimal)
  const allMessages = await extractChatForCommit(...);
  const sessionGroups = groupBySessionId(allMessages);
  const selectedMessages = await selectRelevantSession(sessionGroups, gitDiff);
  4. The key insight I would have missed: That the collector itself does heavy filtering and I should insert session
  logic INSIDE that process, not wrap it externally.
  What I Was Wrong About:
  I probably oversold the "context-filter.js" theory. The function naming might have been misleading, but I likely would
  have traced the call stack and seen that context-integrator.js orchestrates everything.
  The Real Telemetry Win:
  The telemetry didn't just show me the right file - it showed me the exact line numbers (80-94) where project/time
  filtering happens, revealing that I should insert session grouping right there in the filtering loop, not wrap it
  externally.
  Without telemetry, I would have built a wrapper that works but isn't as elegant as inserting the logic into the
  existing filtering pipeline.

## 7:56:31 AM EDT - Commit: e8a220a6 - feat(prd-26): create conference roadmap and update PRD dependencies

### Summary - e8a220a6

In this development session, the developer focused on creating a structured roadmap for preparing a tool for an upcoming conference, alongside making necessary updates to related Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). The primary focus was on establishing PRD-26, the "Conference Ready Implementation Roadmap," which coordinates the implementation of several other critical PRDs in a sequential manner.

The session began with a recap of previous discussions, where the developer sought to analyze PRDs using telemetry data and prioritize upcoming tasks. This led to a significant emphasis on PRD-25 (Session Isolation), which addresses a bug that could compromise the integrity of a live demo. The developer also indicated a desire to dogfood the telemetry-adding agent (PRD-9) first, allowing for real-time instrumentation of fixes across the other PRDs.

Throughout the session, the developer engaged in a detailed analysis of the dependencies between the PRDs. The discussion revealed that while some PRDs could function independently, their order of implementation would benefit from logical sequencing. Thus, a sequence was agreed upon: PRD-9 → PRD-17 → PRD-25 → PRD-23 → PRD-24. This sequence was designed to ensure that the developer could leverage the telemetry tool effectively while preparing for the conference.

Additionally, the developer created GitHub issue #26 to track the new meta-PRD, which serves as a coordination document for the conference preparations. The issue includes links to the respective PRD files and outlines the implementation sequence, success criteria, and risk management strategies.

During the session, the README file was also updated to remove misleading references to "Automated Daily Summaries," which do not accurately reflect the tool's current capabilities. The developer emphasized the importance of maintaining honest documentation about the tool's functionality.

Finally, the developer was ready to commit the changes made to the README and the new meta-PRD. The session concluded with a clear path forward and a well-structured plan for the upcoming conference preparations, ensuring that the developer remains focused and organized while addressing the necessary technical updates.

Overall, this session was productive, with significant progress made towards both the immediate goal of preparing for the conference and the long-term integrity of the project documentation and dependencies.

### Development Dialogue - e8a220a6

**Human:** "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below: [...] The conversation culminated in updating PRD-25 with these telemetry-informed insights and committing the changes."

**Human:** "I need to add critical functionality for my upcoming conference talk and get it packaged and ready to share. What prds so I need to finish before talk time, and in what order? Tell me your opinion. Don't make a plan."

**Human:** "Wait isn't prd-17 still open too?"

**Human:** "I already have the tool. Check the progress to see what still needs doing."

**Human:** "One thing I want to work before the talk is the telemetry-adding agent. Perhaps I do that first and make it work with the code that was written as part of prd-17 (see prd-9 to learn more). Then prd-17 (may be important for demo day because I'll be in Denmark, not my home in Texas), then 25, 23, 24, adding telemetry with the agent all along."

**Human:** "What if there is a prd of prds?"

**Human:** "Perhaps I can temporarily reference this 'prd of prds' in my /prd-next-telemetry-powered prompt? What do you think about that idea? Be critical."

**Human:** "Okay then I propose we creating a meta-PRD (say PRD-26) and updating the conference PRDs (9,17,25,23,24) with real dependency chains. And leave unaffected PRDs alone. If it aint broke. Don't plan yet."

**Human:** "This doesn't have the dependency chain that I envisioned (9 → 17 → 25 → 23 → 24) - do you think that is important?"

**Human:** "Was the whole /prd-create process followed?"

**Human:** "The git issue was created then? That is the part I was thinking about."

**Human:** "I want to remove the summary part from the README. This tool doesn't do that."

### Technical Decisions - e8a220a6

## 10:17:09 AM EDT - Commit: faaa72d1 - feat(prd-9): create /add-telemetry slash command for AI-powered instrumentation

### Summary - faaa72d1

During this development session, the focus was on creating and refining a new slash command, `/add-telemetry`, aimed at automating OpenTelemetry instrumentation for JavaScript and TypeScript code. The command was designed to analyze uninstrumented functions, research applicable OTEL semantic conventions, and generate the necessary telemetry code.

The session began with discussions on the command's structure, including a step for verifying the connection to the Datadog MCP server at the outset. This step ensures that if the telemetry does not appear in Datadog later, it can be traced back to instrumentation issues rather than connection problems. 

The command was built in a series of steps, which included:
1. **Target Discovery**: Initially identifying recently changed code using `git diff` to target files that required instrumentation.
2. **Operation Analysis**: Identifying all uninstrumented functions, emphasizing the experimental nature of this telemetry for AI development assistance, which requires comprehensive coverage of all functions.
3. **Convention Discovery**: Checking existing standards in the codebase to identify gaps and then researching OTEL conventions only for those gaps.
4. **Standards Module Extension**: Adding any new conventions to the standards module, ensuring no hardcoded strings are present in the code.
5. **Code Generation**: Generating spans, metrics, and narrative logs for the identified functions to ensure correlated telemetry.
6. **Validation**: A detailed process to ensure everything works correctly, including running static validation, executing tests, waiting for telemetry ingestion, and querying Datadog for the expected signals.

Throughout the session, there were critical discussions about simplifying the command and ensuring clarity in the instructions and validation process. The developer decided to omit the initial instructions section to avoid confusion and focus on a more streamlined approach.

In terms of technical decisions, there was an emphasis on maintaining a "no hardcoded strings" principle, ensuring all telemetry was correlated, and the importance of narrative logs to provide context alongside spans and metrics.

The session concluded with the developer planning to test the `/add-telemetry` command on actual PRD-17 reflection system functions to validate its effectiveness. Updates to the project documentation (PRD-9 and PRD-26) were committed, reflecting the progress made during this session, while also highlighting that further validation work was still required. 

Overall, the developer and the AI assistant engaged in a thoughtful and iterative process, culminating in a comprehensive automation tool designed to enhance the telemetry capabilities of the codebase while adhering to established best practices.

### Development Dialogue - faaa72d1

**Human:** "I thought that the idea is that this should be written into a new /add-telemetry slash command (or agent?) - am I mistaken? Be critical"

**Human:** "Let’s discuss each header section one at a time. Start with ## Step 1: Target Discovery and then we can evaluate everything before that."

**Human:** "What does that code do exactly?"

**Human:** "I think only the # Check recent changes makes sense."

**Human:** "Is the Look For These Patterns in Target Files necessary? What are the pros and cons?"

**Human:** "Yes remove it."

**Human:** "What are the pros and cons of showing examples vs just saying Read the target file and identify operation types and nothing more?"

**Human:** "I agree with minimal approach. But somewhere in the prompt should we say that we want every function instrumented (except map or something like that, that could make a zillion spans)? The point is that this is instrumented as an experimental technique of aiding AI coding assistant in development rather than for production so it isn't a pattern AI is trained on and it might make wrong assumptions."

**Human:** "Okay I don't think this belongs in step 2 I think it belongs in the header and as part of the checkmarks at the end. Do you agree? Be critical."

**Human:** "Do you think it is clear if a custom attribute is made that it needs to be added to the standards module?" 

**Human:** "Does this mean that all SEMATTRS will eventually become hardcoded?"

**Human:** "Should we validate that we see logs, traces, and metrics? Be critical."

**Human:** "Great. 6.5 should be Create test script and repeat 6.2 and 6.3 and 6.4? What do you think? Be critical."

**Human:** "Does 6.5 sound like too much?"

**Human:** "Should prd-26 get a higher-level work log entry too?"

**Human:** "It still sounds like it is complete."

**Human:** "It isn't complete though. It still needs validation."

**Human:** "Is the Look For These Patterns in Target Files necessary? What are the pros and cons?"

### Developer Reflections - faaa72d1

**9:12:21 AM EDT**

TIL this codebase has only been following OTEL semantic conventions with traces (and even then it could be better by using SEMATTR imports alone), and it has NOT been following OTEL semantic conventions with logs or metrics. See AI assistant output pasted below. Note to future self: make a prd (or several) around refactoring the instrumentation of each signal to use semantic conventions, and updating the telemetry standards module as well as the /add telemetry command to follow the refactored approach.
OTEL has semantic conventions for all three signals:
1. Logs: OTEL has log semantic conventions
  - log.severity (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
  - log.message
  - Plus they inherit trace context (trace_id, span_id)
  - Can use same attributes as spans (like code.function)
2. Metrics: OTEL has metric semantic conventions
  - Naming conventions: http.server.request.duration (unit at end)
  - Required attributes for specific metric types
  - Units: milliseconds, bytes, etc.
  - Same attributes as spans when applicable
The complexity:
- All three signals can share the same semantic convention attributes
- But each signal has its own specific conventions too
- Metrics have naming patterns (dots, underscores, units)
- Logs have severity levels and message formats
In this codebase:
- Spans use OTEL conventions (via standards.js)
- Metrics use commit_story.* custom namespace (not strict OTEL conventions)
- Logs use narrative patterns (custom, not OTEL log conventions)

## 10:36:16 AM EDT - Commit: aeac5a87 - feat(prds): create three PRDs for OTEL semantic convention refactoring

### Summary - aeac5a87

In this development session, the developer focused on creating three Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) aimed at refactoring telemetry conventions in the codebase to align with OpenTelemetry (OTEL) semantic standards. The changes included three new markdown files that detail the planned refactoring of tracing, metrics, and logging conventions.

The first PRD, titled "Refactor Traces to Use OTEL Semantic Convention Imports," outlines the need to replace manual string attributes with official OTEL imports to mitigate risks such as typos, inconsistencies, and harder maintenance. It sets clear success criteria and milestones for implementation, including updating the standards module and existing trace instrumentation.

The second PRD, "Migrate Metrics to OTEL Semantic Conventions," addresses the current use of a custom metric namespace, which poses challenges like reduced portability and compatibility with OTEL tools. This document emphasizes the importance of migrating to standardized naming and unit conventions for metrics while ensuring that existing dashboards remain functional during the transition.

The third PRD, "Standardize Logs with OTEL Semantic Conventions," discusses the need to shift from narrative-style logging to structured logs that adhere to OTEL conventions. This change aims to improve log analysis capabilities and support better tooling integration.

Throughout the session, the developer engaged in discussions about the current telemetry setup, identifying the areas where the codebase was partially compliant with OTEL conventions, particularly in tracing, while highlighting the challenges posed by metrics and logging. The developer also reflected on the importance of keeping the PRDs high-level, allowing for detailed planning at the implementation stage.

As part of the session, the developer also created a comprehensive system architecture diagram based on the telemetry data, though there was an initial misunderstanding concerning the inclusion of VPN logs, which were determined to be irrelevant to the commit_story system.

After finalizing the PRDs, the developer committed the changes to the repository, ensuring that all documentation was linked correctly for future reference. This structured approach will facilitate a more manageable and organized transition to OTEL standards in the codebase, addressing existing issues while paving the way for improved observability and maintainability.

### Development Dialogue - aeac5a87

**Human:** "Look at telemetry data from the past week and from that alone draw me a diagram of this system works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated"

**Assistant:** "[...] I can analyze the telemetry data from the past week to understand how this system works and create a diagram based on the logs, metrics, and traces."

**Human:** "What?! VPN?!"

**Assistant:** "[...] The VPN-related logs I saw are actually from your local machine's VPN client (AppGate SDP) that you use to connect to Datadog's corporate network - not part of the commit_story system itself."

**Human:** "add reflection: change my system discovery prompt to be specific about Commit-Story. Currently it is 'Look at telemetry data from the past week and from that alone draw me a diagram of this system works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated'"

**Human:** "Okay let's add those but you'll have to name them differently. What if we leverage specialized agents for each task. Like create an agent that updates metrics conventions, for example, and then run that agent on each file. Is that a good approach? Be critical. I also think 'Telemetry standards module refactor' and '/add-telemetry' command updates should be milestones that occur individually in the prd for each telemetry pillar. Does that make sense? What do you think? Be critical"

**Human:** "I'm just a single dev working on a side project with a small codebase. I don't think that discovery is needed. Go ahead and use the /prd-create process to make the 3 refactoring prds"

**Human:** "I agree with this but keep the plans high-level. It may be a while before this is implemented and we can plan the details at implementation time."

## 11:43:25 AM EDT - Commit: 9e474983 - docs(prds): update PRDs 9, 17, 26 with telemetry validation progress

### Summary - 9e474983

In this development session, significant updates were made to several Project Requirement Documents (PRDs) focusing on enhancing telemetry validation and documenting progress on the OpenTelemetry automation tooling. The core activities revolved around refining the `/add-telemetry` command and addressing gaps in its validation process.

The developer began by analyzing the functionality of the command that was executed on the `src/managers/journal-manager.js` file, which successfully instrumented several key functions: `discoverReflections()`, `parseReflectionFile()`, `parseReflectionTimestamp()`, `formatJournalEntry()`, and `getJournalFilePath()`. However, it was noted that while these functions were instrumented, the command only validated about 60% of the added telemetry, missing crucial checks such as those for `getJournalFilePath`, which was not called during testing, and the necessary use of the MCP tool to create new reflections for comprehensive validation.

Discussions led to the identification of critical gaps in the validation script and the need for an overhaul of Step 6 in the `/add-telemetry` command. The developer proposed a more structured approach to validation that would ensure 100% coverage of all instrumented functions and metrics, while also detailing the test environment and coverage expectations.

As part of the updates:
1. New design decisions were documented in PRD-9, emphasizing the need for a validation script enhancement and a comprehensive checklist to ensure all telemetry is validated.
2. The PRDs were updated to reflect the successful instrumentation work while clarifying that some functions still require additional coverage, specifically in `context-integrator.js`.
3. PRD-17 and PRD-26 were also updated to highlight the progress made in telemetry instrumentation and validation readiness for upcoming demonstrations.

In summary, the session was productive in identifying areas for improvement in the telemetry tooling, enhancing the validation framework, and ensuring accurate tracking of progress across multiple PRDs. The developer committed the updates, setting the stage for future work sessions focused on implementing the proposed changes.

**Human:** "Love this but also we should validate that our standards are upheld. Otel conventions, narrative logging, every function is instrumented (unless it generates many spans, like a map function)"

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right! Let me revise the plan to include comprehensive validation of our telemetry standards:"

**Human:** "I want to see logs and updates"

**Assistant:** "[...] The command appears to be running. Let me check if there are any recent file changes or outputs:"

**Human:** "Hmmm. Do you think /add-telemetry did a good job?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Let me analyze the quality of the /add-telemetry instrumentation work to give you an honest assessment."

**Human:** "Read @TELEMETRY.md to understand the philosophy and tell me your feedback again"

**Assistant:** "[...] After reading the TELEMETRY.md guide, I need to revise my assessment. The /add-telemetry command actually did an **excellent job** that aligns perfectly with the documented philosophy and patterns."

**Human:** "My qualm is that it did not validate all new traces, logs, and spans... just some, right? Validate this. It should have executed the MCP tool add_reflection, yes? Validate"

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right! Let me check the actual validation that /add-telemetry performed versus what it should have done:"

**Human:** "I think the command might benefit by explaining what trace:test does and letting the tool decide whether to run it or whether to write its own tests. What do you think? Be critical. Also should it have a specific requirement to validate all data?"

**Assistant:** "[...] The current `/add-telemetry` command treats validation as an afterthought checkbox rather than a critical requirement. It should be: "You MUST prove that 100% of your instrumentation works""

**Human:** "propose a plan to change /add-telemetry step 6"

**Assistant:** "[...] Perfect! Let's design each substep carefully. Let's start with **Step 6.1: Static Validation** (which we're keeping as-is)." 

**Human:** "this plan is fine but it is over-perscriptive. Leave room for us to make implementation decisions in the moment"

**Assistant:** "[...] You're absolutely right. Let me update the PRD with more flexible, outcome-focused design decisions rather than over-prescriptive implementation details."

**Human:** "yes. and 26"

**Assistant:** "[...] Let me update all three PRDs with the accurate progress analysis."

### Technical Decisions - 9e474983

- **DECISION: [Telemetry Instrumentation for Reflection Functions]** (Implemented) - FILES: [src/managers/journal-manager.js, src/telemetry/standards.js]
  - Successfully instrumented core reflection functions: `discoverReflections()`, `parseReflectionFile()`, `parseReflectionTimestamp()`, `formatJournalEntry()`, and `getJournalFilePath()`.
  - Enhanced telemetry for reflection processing and file operations.
  - Extended standards module with new span and attribute builders.
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly discussed.

- **DECISION: [Validation Gaps in /add-telemetry Command]** (Discussed) - FILES: [None]
  - Identified that the command only validated ~60% of added telemetry.
  - Noted that `getJournalFilePath` was instrumented but not tested.
  - Discussed the need for comprehensive validation including all spans, metrics, and logs.
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly discussed.

- **DECISION: [Enhancements to Validation Script]** (Discussed) - FILES: [None]
  - Proposed improvements to ensure runtime validation of all telemetry.
  - Suggested adding a checklist for validation completeness.
  - Emphasized the need for intelligent test strategy selection.
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly discussed.

- **DECISION: [Overhaul of /add-telemetry Step 6]** (Discussed) - FILES: [None]
  - Discussed redesigning Step 6 to ensure 100% telemetry validation coverage.
  - Suggested making the command more flexible in its validation approach.
  - Emphasized the importance of understanding the test environment before execution.
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly discussed.

- **DECISION: [PRD Updates for Instrumentation and Validation]** (Implemented) - FILES: [prds/9-otel-automation-tooling.md, prds/17-manual-reflection-tool.md, prds/26-conference-roadmap.md]
  - Updated PRDs to reflect successful instrumentation of functions and identified gaps in validation.
  - Documented design decisions for validation improvements and checklist requirements.
  - Ensured that the progress accurately reflects the current state of the project.
  Tradeoffs: None explicitly discussed.
