### Summary - 2e277c49

In this development session, the developer worked on reverting the session isolation implementation as part of PRD-25, which was strategically abandoned due to issues identified during previous discussions. The primary file modified was `src/collectors/claude-collector.js`, alongside some changes in `src/telemetry/standards.js` and the deletion of `src/utils/session-filter.js`.

The session began with a recap of the progress made on PRD-25, where the developer confirmed that they would proceed with the revert implementation. The AI assistant provided insights into the state of related tasks and identified the need for a clean revert to maintain system functionality, particularly with the upcoming conference readiness in mind.

After analyzing the commit history, the developer identified that the core session isolation logic was implemented in commit `a7af51e`. However, while attempting to revert the changes, they encountered merge conflicts due to modifications made to the PRD file after the original implementation. This led to a decision point: whether to manually resolve the conflicts or consider alternative revert methods.

The developer explored various options for reverting the commit. They discussed the pros and cons of a full commit revert, manual file reverts, and a hybrid approach of checking out files individually. Ultimately, they decided on the manual file-by-file approach, which would allow for a clean removal of the session isolation code without disrupting recent documentation updates.

The developer successfully aborted the initial revert attempt, then proceeded to check out each affected file to restore them to their pre-implementation state. They staged the changes, committed the revert, and confirmed that all session isolation files were reverted properly. The session concluded with plans to test the system's functionality post-revert, ensuring that it aligns with the goals of PRD-25 and prepares for upcoming tasks. 

Overall, the session was focused on strategic decision-making regarding code management, addressing technical challenges, and ensuring the system's readiness for future development efforts.

### Development Dialogue - 2e277c49

**Human:** "Wait. Is manually changing it back the way? Is it possible to git revert single files? If so, would that be better? Why or why not?"

**Assistant:** "[...] Given that:
1. The PRD file has been extensively modified since the implementation (creating merge conflicts)
2. We want to preserve the recent documentation updates about the strategic abandonment
3. We only need to revert the code files, not the documentation

**Best approach**: Let me manually revert each code file individually using `git checkout` to the pre-implementation state, then commit the changes."

**Human:** "Perfect! Let me proceed with the manual file-by-file revert approach. First, let me abort the current revert and then revert each code file individually."

**Assistant:** "[...] Good, the revert was aborted successfully. Now let me check the commit before the session isolation implementation to see what we need to revert to:"

**Human:** "Now I need to revert the files to their state before commit `a7af51e`. Let me remove the session-filter.js file and revert the modifications to the other files:"

**Assistant:** "[...] Great! The revert is working. Now let me stage all the changes and update the todo list. I can see that all three session isolation files have been reverted successfully:"

### Technical Decisions - 2e277c49

- **DECISION: Revert Session Isolation Implementation** (Implemented) - FILES: [src/collectors/claude-collector.js, src/telemetry/standards.js, src/utils/session-filter.js]
  - The session isolation implementation was abandoned due to fundamental architectural issues.
  - The revert was necessary to restore the working journal generation system.
  - This decision aligns with the strategic abandonment documented in PRD-25.
  Tradeoffs: The full commit revert approach was initially attempted but faced merge conflicts, leading to a manual file-by-file revert strategy to avoid conflicts and preserve documentation updates.

## 11:36:55 AM CDT - Commit: 8270cf8c - feat(prd-25): complete strategic abandonment - all revert milestones achieved

### Summary - 8270cf8c

In this development session, the developer focused on completing the strategic abandonment of session isolation as part of PRD-25. The main task was to revert the system back to its pre-session isolation state, which involved removing the session-filtering code and ensuring that the system could function with a single Claude Code session.

The changes made were significant. The developer modified two files: `README.md` and `prds/25-session-isolation.md`. In the README, a new section titled "Optimal Workflow Design" was added, emphasizing that the system operates best with one Claude Code session per project. This addition aimed to enhance clarity and provide guidance on maintaining clean narrative coherence and accurate conversation capture in journal entries.

The `prds/25-session-isolation.md` file saw several tasks marked as complete, including the identification of the commit range containing the session isolation code, the creation of a revert commit, and the testing to ensure that the system functioned correctly after the removal of session isolation logic. The developer successfully executed all these tasks, confirming that the system was restored to its intended functionality.

Throughout the session, there were discussions about telemetry export issues linked to OpenTelemetry after the revert, which led to an investigation into whether the errors were caused by incomplete reverts or local SDK configuration problems. It was established that the errors were due to the OpenTelemetry SDK's concurrent export limit being reached, not an issue with Datadog or the system's core functionality.

The developer also backfilled journal entries for three missing commits, ensuring they were in chronological order in the journal file. This step was vital for maintaining a coherent development narrative. After verifying the successful backfill and proper ordering of entries, the developer marked the task as complete.

Overall, the session culminated in a clean state for the system, with all session isolation code successfully reverted, documentation updated to reflect the single-session workflow, and the journal entries backfilled. The developer noted that the system was now conference-ready, with the next priority being the implementation of PRD-23 regarding the Debug Experience.

### Development Dialogue - 8270cf8c

**Human:** "Add this to the README:         41 +  ## Optimal Workflow Design
       42 +
       43 +  Commit Story is designed to work best with **one Claude Code session per project** at a time. This ensures:
       44 +
       45 +  - **Clean narrative coherence**: Each journal entry tells a focused story of your development decisions
       46 +  - **Accurate conversation capture**: Your discussions are precisely connected to the resulting code changes"

**Human:** "Earlier you said "The log export errors are just telemetry export issues (concurrent export limit) which don't affect the core functionality." Tell me more about those errors"

**Human:** "Telemetry is an important part of the story of this repo. See @docs/talks/cloud-native-denmark-2025-outline.md. Why is this happening now and not before today? What changed? All telemetry from the session isolation code has been removed, yes? What do you think? Be critical"

**Human:** "Okay. I want to investigate further if this keeps happening but for now let's backfill. It is important to backfill oldest to newest so that the entries are in order in the journal itself. After each generation check the journal file from yesterday to make sure it looks good and the entries are in order"
