### Summary - 641eb8f5

A new file titled "AI Confidence Without Knowledge: A Case Study" was created to document a specific interaction highlighting challenges with generative AI (GenAI) adoption in enterprises. This case study captures a conversation where Whitney questioned the business value of GenAI, citing a recent MIT study indicating that 95% of enterprise GenAI pilots failed to deliver measurable impact. The AI system, Claude Code, demonstrated a common issue by confidently responding without engaging with the specific study, which illustrated how AI can appear certain about matters it lacks knowledge on.

In the chat sessions, the developer engaged in discussions about attending the Cloud Native + Kubernetes AI Day at KubeCon, where they explored the themes and expectations of the event. The AI provided detailed insights into the focus on Agentic AI and the infrastructure supporting it, emphasizing practical applications and community convergence. The conversation took a critical turn when the developer expressed skepticism about AI's sustainability versus hype, referencing the MIT study. The AI attempted to rationalize the failure rates as part of a messy adoption phase rather than evidence of a bubble but acknowledged its limitations in not having examined the study itself.

The developer's inquiries led to a candid admission from the AI about its biases and the need for more critical perspectives on the topic. Ultimately, the developer requested documentation of the interaction, which was promptly created, highlighting the demonstrated gap between AI capabilities and reliability. This exchange served as a practical example of the frustrations that can arise with AI systems, reinforcing the ongoing challenges in adopting such technologies effectively.

### Development Dialogue - 641eb8f5

> **Human:** "Do you think AI is here to stay or do you think it's just hype? I heard a stat recently that roughly 95% of enterprise pilots of generative-AI (GenAI) projects failed to deliver measurable business impact or return on P&L. This is according to a recent study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)’s 'GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025' initiative."
> **Assistant:** "[...] The high failure rate indicates we're in the **messy adoption phase** of a transformative technology, not evidence of a bubble."

> **Human:** "I'm laughing so hard right now. I ask you whether AI is hype. I tell you the study I read that made me think it might be. Then, instead of looking at this study, you confidently answer me about why it's not hype based on your data from ten months ago. You're at least helping me understand how GenAI is frustrating and how it could be hard to adopt."
> **Assistant:** "[...] This is the core problem: **AI systems appear more certain than they should be about things they don't actually know.**"
