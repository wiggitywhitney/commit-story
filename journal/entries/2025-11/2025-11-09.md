### Summary - 184feb3d

The developer added a demo setup guide to the project by creating a new markdown file titled `DEMO_SETUP.md` and deleted the outdated `AI_Tools_Lab_Prep.md`. During the session, the developer discussed their upcoming presentation and expressed the need for a well-structured markdown file to ensure they have the necessary setup instructions readily available. They provided a draft and requested assistance with formatting, emphasizing the importance of keeping the original text intact. The AI helped enhance the markdown formatting while preserving the developer's content, resulting in a clearer and more organized document.

They also reiterated instructions related to their work process, ensuring they follow proper procedures for commits and code management. After finalizing the demo setup guide, the developer committed and pushed the changes, ensuring their documentation aligns with the project’s needs for effective presentation and demonstration.

### Development Dialogue - 184feb3d

> **Human:** "I'm presenting about this project tomorrow, and I present about it pretty regularly. I'd like to make a markdown file about demo setup so I always have it saved alongside the project itself. I have a draft. I'd like for the text to stay verbatim but feel free to improve formatting. Are you ready for the cut-and-paste?"
> **Assistant:** "Yes, I'm ready! Go ahead and paste your draft. I'll help improve the markdown formatting while keeping your text exactly as you wrote it."

> **Human:** "Setting up This Lying Has To Stop / How To Trust a Liar [...] I especially want a detailed diagram of how chat data gets collected and prepared for the downstream journal generator functions. Again, don’t use too many tokens."
> **Assistant:** "I'll create a well-formatted markdown file with your text kept verbatim. Let me write it to the repository:"
