### Summary - b65a55c6

The developer updated the conference abstract in the file `abstracts/when-codebase-instruments-itself.md` by modifying the text to reflect that Commit Story is now described as a "Gen-AI powered, automated engineering journal." This change enhances the clarity and relevance of the content presented for the upcoming conference. Additionally, the developer deleted several files, including the `datadog-advocacy-team-overview.md` and `edinburgh-itinerary.md`, indicating a shift in focus away from those topics. They also generated new journal entries and configuration files for a reflection tool in the `journal/reflections` directory, which suggests an ongoing effort to document their thoughts and progress in the project. Overall, this session involved a mix of updating content, deleting obsolete files, and creating new documentation structures for personal reflections.
