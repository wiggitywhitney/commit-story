### Summary - f934c6bc

Commit Story is a GenAI-powered, automated engineering journal triggered by Git commits. For the speaker, this personal project became a playground for exploring how telemetry can inform AI coding assistants at development time. Her path to adding instrumentation likely mirrors that of many teams: an effort to follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, reinforced first through documentation, then later through a shared library of standards. Eventually, she built an AI agent that reads OpenTelemetry docs, discovers conventions, extends the standards module, instruments the code, and validates that it all works by querying the backend. This talk shares what that process revealed—how automation reshapes telemetry design—and includes a live demo showing how integrating OpenTelemetry Weaver formalized those standards, enabling the Telemetry Agent to work across multiple codebases.

This talk demonstrates a practical application of AI in maintaining observability standards—a pain point many teams face as they scale. Attendees will learn how to enforce telemetry conventions through code, not just documentation; a working pattern for AI-assisted instrumentation they can adapt; how OpenTelemetry Weaver formalizes these standards; and real-world lessons from building and validating automated instrumentation. The approach is immediately applicable: teams can adopt the builder pattern today, and the AI agent technique works with any LLM API. By showing both the successes and mistakes in this journey, the talk helps others avoid common pitfalls when implementing automated observability.

For additional resources, the demo app (already instrumented with OpenTelemetry, but not Weaver yet) can be found at: [https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story). The "add-telemetry" agent specifically is located at: [https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/blob/main/.claude/commands/add-telemetry.md](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story/blob/main/.claude/commands/add-telemetry.md).

### Developer Reflections - f934c6bc

**5:05:17 AM CDT**

I am enjoying using this project in other repos. One thing I'm craving though is more quotes. For some reason, there tends to be only two or three each time. I thought we set it to be higher than that. This is something I want to look into in the future when I have enough time for commit story to be a high priority again.
