**PRD-18 Context Capture Tool - Implementation Session**

Completed simplification and implementation of flexible two-mode context capture system for the Commit Story journal project.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1. **Simplified MCP Tools** - Removed timestamp override parameter from both reflection and context capture tools. Tools now automatically use current timestamp, eliminating unnecessary API surface and cognitive overhead.

2. **Implemented DD-011: Flexible Two-Mode Context Capture**
   - Mode 1 (Comprehensive Dump): Calling with empty/omitted text triggers comprehensive prompt, AI provides rich analysis in follow-up
   - Mode 2 (Direct Capture): Calling with specific text writes immediately to file
   - AI naturally interprets user intent ("capture context" → Mode 1, "capture why we chose X" → Mode 2)

3. **Implemented DD-012: Remove Arbitrary Character Limits** - Deleted 10,000 character validation. No technical justification for the limit, file system handles large files easily, users can manage file sizes naturally.

4. **File Rename for Clarity** - Renamed context-tool.js → context-capture-tool.js to avoid confusion with other context usage (OpenTelemetry context, React context, etc.)

**Technical Changes:**
- context-capture-tool.js: Mode detection logic checks for empty/missing text, returns prompt or writes to file
- server.js: Made text parameter optional (removed from required array), updated descriptions
- Eliminated telemetry for has_custom_timestamp (no longer tracked)
- Updated PRD-18 with DD-011 and DD-012, marked as outstanding until tested

**Design Rationale:**
The two-mode approach balances comprehensive session checkpoints with focused documentation. Rather than forcing all captures through a verbose dump flow, we let the AI interpret user intent naturally. "Capture context" triggers rich analysis, while "capture debugging steps we took" produces focused content directly.

**Testing Status:**
- Mode 1 working: Empty text triggers comprehensive prompt ✅
- Mode 2 pending: Need to test direct capture with provided text
- Session ID auto-detection: Working from previous implementations
- File append logic: Preserved from M2 implementation

**Next Steps:**
- Complete Mode 2 testing
- Update PRD-18 milestones to mark M3 complete
- Phase 2: Journal integration (context discovery and narrative enhancement)
- Phase 3: Add telemetry via /add-telemetry command
