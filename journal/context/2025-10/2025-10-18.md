# Branch + PR Workflow Experiment

**What we're testing**: Whether a branch + PR + CodeRabbit review workflow adds value for solo development with AI assistance.

**Current state**: 
- Feature branch: `feature/prd-32-phase-3-diff-filtering`
- PRD-32 Phase 3 implementation COMPLETE on branch
- All tests passing:
  - Mixed commits filter journal entries from diffs ✅
  - Reflections/context preserved (not filtered) ✅
  - Context bleed eliminated (commit 441db893 regenerates cleanly) ✅

**Commits on branch**:
1. `a38523d` - docs: add workflow experiment doc
2. `c41de1c` - feat: implement Phase 3 diff-level filtering
3. `b6e7ad1` - test: mixed commit to verify filtering
4. `f08eb69` - docs: test reflection preservation
5. (pending) - test cleanup commit

**Next steps**:
1. Finish cleanup commit on branch
2. Push branch to remote
3. Create PR with description of Phase 3 work
4. Request CodeRabbit review
5. Observe review quality and timing
6. Merge to main (if approved)
7. Revisit `docs/workflow-experiment.md` with actual findings

**Key questions to answer**:
- Does CodeRabbit catch issues we missed?
- How much time overhead does PR process add?
- What happens to journal entries on branch vs main?
- Is AI reviewing AI code valuable or just noise?

**Implementation details**:
- Added git pathspec `:!journal/entries/` to git-collector.js
- Added file filtering in commit-content-analyzer.js
- Both changes work together to eliminate journal pollution from diffs
