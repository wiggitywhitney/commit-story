## PRD-32 Phase 5 Validation - Pre-Testing State Capture

### Current Repository State (Baseline for Cleanup)
- **Branch**: `main`
- **HEAD commit**: `23cedf7` - "chore: regenerate journal entries for 2025-10-22"
- **Sync status**: Up to date with `origin/main`
- **Untracked files**: 
  - `CLAUDE.md` (user config, not part of testing)
  - `journal/context/2025-10/2025-10-21.md` (existing context capture)

### Existing Journal Files (Pre-Test Baseline)
- **Entries**: 23 files in `journal/entries/2025-10/` covering Oct 1-22
- **Reflections**: 8 files in `journal/reflections/2025-10/`
- **Context**: 1 untracked file in `journal/context/2025-10/`

### Testing Strategy for Phase 5 Validation

**Objective**: Validate all aspects of PRD-32 journal filtering implementation (Phases 2-4) without polluting main branch or commit history.

**Test Isolation Approach**:
1. Create dedicated test branch: `test/prd-32-phase-5-validation`
2. All test commits will be made on test branch (not main)
3. Test-generated journal entries will be isolated to test branch
4. Merge scenario tests will use temporary throwaway branches
5. After validation complete, delete test branch and return to baseline state

**Tests to Execute**:

**Phase 2 Tests (Hook-Level Prevention)**:
- Test 1: Journal-entry-only commit (should skip hook execution)
- Test 2: Reflection-only commit (should run hook normally - manual content)
- Test 3: Context-only commit (should run hook normally - manual content)

**Phase 3 Tests (Diff-Level Filtering)**:
- Test 4: Mixed commit (journal entries + code changes) - verify journal filtered from diff
- Test 5: Context pollution regression test - regenerate commit 441db893, verify no AGPL license bleed

**Phase 4 Tests (Merge Commit Handling)**:
- Test 6: Merge scenario 1 - Clean merge, no chat, no diff (should skip)
- Test 7: Merge scenario 2 - Clean merge with chat, no diff (should generate) - ALREADY VALIDATED with bb6a16f
- Test 8: Merge scenario 3 - Merge with conflicts, no chat, has diff (should generate)
- Test 9: Merge scenario 4 - Merge with conflicts and chat (should generate)

**Cleanup Strategy**:
After all tests complete, restore baseline state:
```bash
git checkout main                              # Return to main branch
git branch -D test/prd-32-phase-5-validation  # Delete test branch and all test commits
git clean -fd journal/                         # Remove any stray test journal files
# Verify return to commit 23cedf7
```

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- ✅ Main branch history remains clean
- ✅ All test artifacts contained and easily discarded
- ✅ Can review test results before cleanup
- ✅ Real-world merge scenarios testable without permanent pollution
- ✅ Easy rollback to exact baseline state (commit 23cedf7)

**Context**: This validation is the final phase of PRD-32, a P0-Critical fix for journal entry recursive generation and context pollution issues. Phases 2-4 are implemented but only partially tested. Phase 5 will provide comprehensive end-to-end validation before marking PRD-32 complete and closing GitHub issue #32.
