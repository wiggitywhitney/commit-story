This prd-25 seems done but I want to do a few things still. I want to (1) have ai emit reasoning while it is being tested (2) in a use case where the /clear slash command is used, it should pick up the session id both before (where /clear is the last user message - what does that look like exactly) and after (probably a timestamp that happens at basically the same time as /clear command) - should this be programatic or written into AI prompt? (3) test using the commit that happens next, I used the /clear command after writing code and before running the /add-telemetry command (4) rerun the add-telemetry command if needed, with the instruction to test with the commit number that is known to have the /clear command fix

Looking for user's reflection about /clear session continuation - they want to discuss programmatic handling
