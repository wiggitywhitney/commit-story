After running the clear command, CC still already has access to:

  - The working directory path and git status
  - Recent commit messages and file paths
  - Environment information (OS, date, etc.)
  - The project structure hints from the git status

Therefore, when I demo how much CC can understand with telemetry alone, specifically direct CC not to use those sources.
