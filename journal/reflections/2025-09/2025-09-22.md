I'm not happy with my journal entries, especially for long commit periods. The entries seem to bury the lead and don't clearly highlight the main achievements. For example, today's major accomplishment was implementing the MCP Server Foundation and reflection tools, but that got lost in all the telemetry implementation details. I need to improve how I capture and present the most important outcomes from each development session.
