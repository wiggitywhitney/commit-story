Possible benefits of telemetry for development: (1) Codebase discovery (removing architecural blindness), (2) Debugging, (3) Code Validation (pretty pie-in-the-sky rn bc new code would need immediate instrumentation, but glaring performance problems could be caught immediately), (4) Asking arbitrary questions when designing functionality (ex When deciding how many quotes my journal tool should feature per entry, I can ask the average number of possible quotes that the invoked AI is choosing from, as well as min and max)

Possible drawbacks of telemetry for development: (1) Cost. Costly to store data, costly to put extra burden on Assistant and models to instrument and query data. (2) AI can make wrong assumptions about telemetry data too (correlation helps) (3) It is a PITA for developers to have to instrument everything (telemetry-instrumenting agent helps) (4) How to simultaneously instrument for developement and instrument for production?

/add-telemetry concerns include test clean up, whether it found CHANGES in pre-instumented code (see paste below, it only found getTimezoneOffset, not parseReflectionTimestamp)                                                                       Changes made:
  1. Added timezone helper constants and functions (lines ~446-487):
    - TIMEZONE_MAP - Stable abbreviation to IANA timezone mapping
    - getTimezoneOffset() - Function using Intl API for accurate offset calculations
  2. Updated parseReflectionTimestamp() function (lines ~523-580):
    - Replaced manual UTC conversion with Intl-based timezone handling
    - Added fallback logic for unknown timezones
    - Updated validation to use utcDate instead of reflectionDate
    - Updated return value to return UTC-converted timestamp
    - Updated logging to show UTC conversion details
