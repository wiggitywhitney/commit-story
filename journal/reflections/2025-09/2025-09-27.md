I just had a great design conversation with my assistant where telemetry really helped. I'm attempting to capture it here. 

Me: The chat goes through some filtering/processing before reaching generator functions. Do we do that filtering on both chats and then let the ai invocation decide? Use trace data to understand the execution path.

Assistant: [[makes a plan with execution path data]]

Assistant casually also says: What's interesting is that the current context.filter_messages shows 0ms duration.

Me: Oh? What do the narrative logs say?

The correlated traces & logs showed filtering happens in the collector at lines 80-94, so that's where session grouping needed to happen, not in the later context integration step (context.filter_messages). Most filtering is in claude-collector.js (project/time filtering). With trace data alone, AI first assumed filtering happens at context.filter_messages but that function only does lightweight noise filtering.

I also think AI would have rewritten the funtionality altogether had it not been for telemetry data. So it went like:
(1) no trace data: write duplicated functionality, or maybe reached same conclusion as #2 because of keyword match
(2) traces alone: AI sees a function with the keyword "filter_messages", assumes it should happen there
(3) correlated traces + logs: AI finds the right spot to add the logic!

This is what AI would have happened without telemetry: Static Analysis Path:

  1. I would have started in context-integrator.js because that's clearly the orchestration layer that calls everything
  else. It's the most obvious place to add new logic.
  2. I would have seen the extractChatForCommit() call and probably thought "this is where I need to add session logic" -
   which would have been closer to correct.
  3. But I likely would have wrapped it externally rather than modifying the collector internally:
  // Probably would have done this (suboptimal)
  const allMessages = await extractChatForCommit(...);
  const sessionGroups = groupBySessionId(allMessages);
  const selectedMessages = await selectRelevantSession(sessionGroups, gitDiff);
  4. The key insight I would have missed: That the collector itself does heavy filtering and I should insert session
  logic INSIDE that process, not wrap it externally.

  What I Was Wrong About:

  I probably oversold the "context-filter.js" theory. The function naming might have been misleading, but I likely would
  have traced the call stack and seen that context-integrator.js orchestrates everything.

  The Real Telemetry Win:

  The telemetry didn't just show me the right file - it showed me the exact line numbers (80-94) where project/time
  filtering happens, revealing that I should insert session grouping right there in the filtering loop, not wrap it
  externally.

  Without telemetry, I would have built a wrapper that works but isn't as elegant as inserting the logic into the
  existing filtering pipeline.

TIL this codebase has only been following OTEL semantic conventions with traces (and even then it could be better by using SEMATTR imports alone), and it has NOT been following OTEL semantic conventions with logs or metrics. See AI assistant output pasted below. Note to future self: make a prd (or several) around refactoring the instrumentation of each signal to use semantic conventions, and updating the telemetry standards module as well as the /add telemetry command to follow the refactored approach.

OTEL has semantic conventions for all three signals:

1. Logs: OTEL has log semantic conventions
  - log.severity (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
  - log.message
  - Plus they inherit trace context (trace_id, span_id)
  - Can use same attributes as spans (like code.function)
2. Metrics: OTEL has metric semantic conventions
  - Naming conventions: http.server.request.duration (unit at end)
  - Required attributes for specific metric types
  - Units: milliseconds, bytes, etc.
  - Same attributes as spans when applicable

The complexity:
- All three signals can share the same semantic convention attributes
- But each signal has its own specific conventions too
- Metrics have naming patterns (dots, underscores, units)
- Logs have severity levels and message formats

In this codebase:
- Spans use OTEL conventions (via standards.js)
- Metrics use commit_story.* custom namespace (not strict OTEL conventions)
- Logs use narrative patterns (custom, not OTEL log conventions)

change my system discovery prompt to be specific about Commit-Story. Currently it is "Look at telemetry data from the past week and from that alone draw me a diagram of this system works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated"
