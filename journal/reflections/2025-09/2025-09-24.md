The "narrative" logger might be an important part of the story. I'm adding logs that specifically help tell the story of what's happening in the system to the future AI instance who reads them. This is different than traditional logs. Also a point that is worth making about this telemetry-for-AI-coding-assistant concept I'm exploring is that I'm tracing all sorts of smaller components that wouldn't normally get a trace
