I had a thought about the prd we abandonded as part of prd 26, about session isolation. What if all we do is group the message by session id so they're not all mixed together? And still kept everything else as-is. That will help the invoked AI better understand the conversation threads.

Current prompt is "Look at telemetry data from the past three days and from that alone draw me a diagram of how this codebase works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated"

The diagram drawing missed the MCP server. CC recommends this: Add specificity about what to include:

  "Look at telemetry data from the past three days and from that alone draw me a diagram of how this codebase works. Include all
  services, external dependencies, and integration points (like MCP servers, APIs, databases). Remember the logs, metrics, and traces
   are correlated."

  Or be more explicit:

  "Look at telemetry data from the past three days and from that alone draw me a comprehensive diagram of how this codebase works.
  Make sure to identify:
  - All services and components
  - External dependencies and APIs
  - Integration points (MCP servers, etc.)
  - Data flow between components

  Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated."

  The key is signaling you want comprehensive coverage of all components, not just the main execution flow.

consider using fewer tokens by asking to only use 24 hours' worth of data instead of one week
