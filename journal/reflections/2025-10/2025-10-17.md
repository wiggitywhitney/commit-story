Should I update install script to add `commit-story.config.json` to .gitignore?

Here's what's swirling around in my head right now. We're almost done with PRD-18 which includes a README update about the new tool, therefore the new tool should get packaged and released in an app update, yes? Should we add that to the PRD?  Then another problem I see is that I'm starting to notice some context bleed between entries that I think is coming from journal entries being fed to the AI generator functions. This wasn't happening before. For example the entry titled `## 9:17:25 AM GMT+1 - Commit: 441db893 - chore: gitignore commit-story.config.json in user repos` contains info about the licensing from the commit before. I'd like to fix this before a new version comes out. I think there is a PRD around it already. But since it is only recently a problem I'd like to look at a trace from 3 weeks ago and see whether there is journal entry file filtering in there somewhere, that is now being bypassed.
