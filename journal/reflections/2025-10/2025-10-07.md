I want to demo Commit Story at a conference I have coming up in Aarhus.

Before the presentation:
I'll have a conversation with Claude Code about how I have some leisure time to explore Aarhus and what should I do. We will work together to make an itenerary. Then I'll stage the changes in git and clear CC's context. 'dev' and 'debug' modes will be set to true.

For the demo:
First I'll ask CC to commit the staged changes. Acknowledge the logs and say that Commit Story is designed to run silently in the background. Then I'll flip over to VS Code and wait for the generated file to appear. It will take less than 30 seconds so I'll think about how to fill that time, maybe with some jokes. Or better yet, some "What the heck does this have to do with cloud computing?!" banter. They'll see the entry! Oooh Ahhh! Then I'll go back go Claude Code and ask CC to use correlated telemetry data from the latest commit to draw me a diagram of how the system works, then I'll talk through it. Then I'll ask CC to query more telemetry data over the last x number of days and draw an updated diagram.

With GenAI-assisted coding we have this massive onslaught of code we don't fully understand "Our systems were snakes. And we used to be fed mice, newly-written code, to digest and integrate. All of the sudden we're being fed elephants!" How can we cope? Maybe OpenTelemetry and code instrumentation can help.
