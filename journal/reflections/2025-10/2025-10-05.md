What if my presentation opens like this: (1) Claude Code is open and the context is cleared. I also have VS Code open (unseen)  "You know how now with the proliferation of tools like Claude Code everyone thinks they're an app developer now?" pause "Well look at this app I made with the help of Claude Code! I'm so very proud of it"

(2) Then tell Claude to commit the staged changes. Flip to VS Code to show the engineering journal entry that appears. Perhaps about adding a Rick Roll feature that runs when, in config, RickRoll:true? The feature runs the app in the foreground and shows rick roll logs? Just spitballing. Or, since I won't keep building the same feature every time I give this talk, maybe I build it now and act surprised to find it. Hoe about this: First demo the app running in the background. Then show how it can run in the foreground too with debug and dev logs... but there are rick roll logs in there too! Okay, let's put a pin in that right now, it is getting complicated

(2) Then tell Claude to commit the staged changes. debug:true and dev:true, but explain it is designed to run silently in the background. Perhaps the journal entry that appears is about a preveious conversation with Claude about creating a list of activities for my time in Aarhus, and resulted in the creation of a file.

(3) Then use the traceID that printed to the console and tell Claude Code to use that trace plus correlated telemetry to understand my system and draw me a diagram of how it works. Explain to the audience how my journal system works.

## 2:40:19 AM CDT

(4) Then ask it to use wider Commit Story data collected over the last x number of days to update the diagram to show other features of the system that didn't get called as part of that journal creation, plus add some interesting stats to the diagram too (I'm hoping it will catch the MCP server here). Go over results

## 2:42:15 AM CDT

(5) (This step could be instead of or in addition to step 4) Ask claude code use telemetry data to zoom in on one section (chat collection?) and explain how just that piece of the system works

## 2:47:28 AM CDT

(6) "How many of you have played around with coding assistants, show of hands?" pause "Okay then, you all can have my back. You know that what I'm doing here, use telemetry to understand my system's runtime behavior at development time - this is not normal. The datadog telemetry-fetching tool I'm using for this demo is in preview. This is an entirely new use case for telemetry and code instrumentation."

## 2:52:21 AM CDT

(7) Level set about what OpenTelemetry is. (8) Show an explain an instrumented function, perhaps one that showed up as part of chat gathering? Be honest that when I've instumented for development insights I've added WAY more instrumentation than I would for production (Instrument EVERYTHING! Narrative logs!) (9) Ask: how might this improve your ai-assisted coding experience?

## 2:56:30 AM CDT

(10) First answer that question with a story, I'm thinking a dramatized version of the debugging & architectural blindness experience from Friday Oct 3. I'm thinking with slides and back-and-forth quotes. Include lots of relatable AI behaviors

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2:58:26 AM CDT

(11) Then go over these benefits of telemetry for development: (A) Codebase discovery (removing architecural blindness), (B) Debugging, (C) Code Validation (glaring performance problems could be caught immediately), (D) Asking arbitrary questions when designing functionality (ex When deciding how many quotes my journal tool should feature per entry, I can ask the average number of possible quotes that the invoked AI is choosing from, as well as min and max)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3:01:46 AM CDT

(12) Then go over possible drawbacks of telemetry for development: (A) Cost. Costly to store data, costly to put extra burden on Assistant and models to instrument and query data. Also coding assistant will do the HUGEST calls through MCP server if I don't watch it (B) AI can make wrong assumptions about telemetry data too (correlation helps) (a story would be good here) (C) It is a PITA for developers to have to instrument everything (D) How to simultaneously instrument for developement and instrument for production?

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3:03:14 AM CDT

(13) Talk about my handmade telemetry-instrumenting agent (maybe demo it if there is time) (14) Say goodbye! Is there another demo I can do to go out with a bang?
