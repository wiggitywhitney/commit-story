I've been thinking that, instead of parsing the context captures and passing them in as additional input to the journal generator functions, why don't we just prevent the capture_context tool calls from getting filtered? My concern with parsing them and adding them as their own piece of context for the journal generators is that whatever was captured there might get unfairly prioritized, especially for whatever chat and code changes come after the context capture moment(s). If context capture is included as part of chat that keeps the design simpler and also gives that info in the context of everything else that is happening at that moment. It seems simpler than trying to wrangle the AI with prompts to use the timestamp to consider the story.
