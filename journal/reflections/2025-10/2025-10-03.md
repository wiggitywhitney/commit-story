I used the prompt "Look at telemetry data from the past three days and from that alone draw me a diagram of how this codebase works. Remember the logs, metrics, and traces are correlated. Be mindful of token use", and I got a good result. Some critiques include (1) even with the "be mindful of token use" directive, it still did a huge "list spans" query to datadog and got the error message "⚠ Large MCP response (~13.5k tokens), this can fill up context quickly" (2) it missed the MCP server again. But, honestly, the diagram is conference-worthy even with the flaws

I followed up with the prompt "Thanks for the diagram. It looks good! Now zoom in and draw me a diagram of what exactly the Chat Data Discovery section does" and I got a good result! Pretty cool

The first iteration of the Technical Decisions prompt was "## Step 1: Identify Significant Technical Decisions

You are the Code Archivist, custodian of the project's history.

Identify technical decisions in the chat that future developers would need to understand why choices were made - decisions with explicit reasoning, alternatives considered, or trade-offs discussed that aren't obvious from code alone.

Discard routine maintenance, documentation updates, and decisions without meaningful rationale.

If no significant decisions exist, note: "No significant decisions found."

When investigating why the session generator was timing out, we saw huge prompts making it to the generators. AI suggested writing new filtering functionality. AI suggested we add it to context filtering (src/integrators/context-integrator.js) where other message cleanup happens. AI would have moved forward with this plan (and, admittedly, it would have worked). But then I asked AI to look at trace data to understand the full execution path first. In doing so, AI discovered that the system already has logic for filtering out these huge tool call messages, and we put together that when we added the session grouping functionality we added a bug where we bypassed this filtering.

Note! Commit 8db5ceb4 broke filtering functionality. Redo the journal entry for this commit and every commit after it.

The fixed functionality was able to be verified with trace data too: "The Datadog traces confirm the fix is working:

Before fix (trace 8a9349bf):
- Root span: messages_count: 174, total_messages: 448
- Generators received: 448 messages (unfiltered)
- Result: Dialogue timed out after 60 seconds

After fix (trace 9bc445d5):
- Root span: messages_count: 174
- Generators received: 175 messages (filtered - slight increase likely from one more message during regeneration)
- Result: All generators completed successfully, no timeouts"

if discussion prompts isn't returning good quotes, consider implementing a quote scoring system like so: Step 4 Narrow to Best Quotes - For each quote in your filtered list, assign an interest score (1-5): 5 Essential captures a key decision or insight, 4 Strong shows meaningful discussion or challenge, 3 Good relevant but not critical, 2 Weak routine but somewhat relevant, 1 Skip doesn't add value. Select quotes scoring 4-5. If you have fewer than maxQuotes quotes, you may include some 3s. Journalists choose quality over quantity.

I'm loving the result of the new dialogue prompt. The only issue I see is that it was a really long session and it only chose quotes from the first part of the session. It did not choose the most interesting quotes overall, instead it chose the first most interesting quotes
