spider-rainbows repo is running commit-story v1.2.1. I thought refections got added to journal entries (in addition to their own dedicated files) but the one I added during the commit window was not in my entry. See affected entry here: /Users/whitney.lee/Documents/Repositories/spider-rainbows/journal/entries/2025-10/2025-10-21.md (commit ae529434). Investigate this
