# Commit Story

> Automated Git Journal System with AI Assistant Context Integration

<!-- PRD-001: This project implements the automated git journal system as specified in PRD-001 -->

## Overview

Commit Story automatically generates meaningful development narratives by combining git commit data with AI assistant conversation context. Never lose the "why" behind your code changes again.

## Key Features

<!-- PRD-001: Core functionality as defined in Feature Requirements FR-001 through FR-017 -->

- **üîÑ Automatic Triggering**: Seamlessly integrates with git via post-commit hooks
- **üß† AI-Powered Summaries**: Converts technical changes into readable English narratives  
- **üí¨ Conversation Context**: Captures insights from Claude Code chat interactions
- **üìù Daily Journaling**: Aggregates commits into daily markdown files
- **üéØ Quote Extraction**: Preserves key insights from AI assistant conversations
- **‚ö° Background Processing**: Zero workflow interruption

## How It Works

<!-- PRD-001: Implementation follows architecture defined in Architecture Overview section -->

1. **Git Commit** - You commit code as usual
2. **Context Collection** - System gathers git diff, commit message, and recent Claude Code conversations
3. **AI Processing** - OpenAI analyzes context and generates meaningful summary with quotes
4. **Journal Entry** - Daily markdown file updated with new entry in `journal/` directory

## Quick Start

<!-- PRD-001: Installation process will be developed in Phase 3 milestone M3.4 -->

*Coming soon - this project is currently in active development*

## Configuration

<!-- PRD-002: File exclusion configuration system per requirements TR-023, TR-024, TR-025 -->

### File Exclusions

You can exclude files and directories from journal generation by creating a `.commitstoryignore` file in your repository root. This is useful for filtering out administrative files, task management documents, or other content that creates noise in your development journal.

**Example `.commitstoryignore`:**
```
# Exclude PRD and project management files
prds/
*.prd.md
project-management/

# Exclude documentation drafts
docs/drafts/
*.draft.md

# Exclude specific files
TODO.md
ROADMAP.md
```

**Supported Patterns:**
- File paths: `specific-file.md`
- Directory paths: `directory/` (trailing slash recommended)
- Glob patterns: `*.extension`, `path/**/*.md`
- Comments: Lines starting with `#`

**What Gets Filtered:**
- **Git diffs** - Changes to excluded files are removed from context
- **Chat messages** - Messages heavily referencing excluded files are filtered
- **Preserved** - Commit messages remain intact for narrative continuity

**Built-in Exclusions:**
- `journal/` directory is automatically excluded to prevent recursion
