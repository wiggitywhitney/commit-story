# Commit Story: Your Engineering Journey, Remembered

Automatically capture not just what you built, but why it mattered and how you solved it.

## What is Commit Story?

Commit Story transforms your git commits into rich journal entries by combining:
- Your actual code changes
- Conversations with your AI coding assistant (currently Claude Code)
- The technical decisions and trade-offs you made

Every commit triggers a background process that creates a narrative record of your development work - no workflow interruption, just automatic documentation that captures the real story.

## Why Use It?

**For yourself:**
- Remember why you made certain choices and how you overcame obstacles
- See your growth as a developer, not just a list of commits
- Boost your learning - [15 minutes of daily reflection improves performance by 20-25%](https://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/files/2013/08/reflection-1di0i76.pdf)

**For your career:**
- Evidence for performance reviews and career advancement
- Material for conference talks and blog posts
- Documentation that captures the real engineering journey

**For your team:**
- Onboard new developers with the actual story behind decisions
- Make retrospectives meaningful with concrete examples
- Preserve institutional knowledge that usually gets lost
